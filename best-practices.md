I'm kind of a best-practices geek. I use iPhone apps for monitoring my hydration, and my running routine. I wear minimalist shoes that have a low profile so as to mimic the natural gait developed by our ancestors. I try to improve my productivity using GTD techniques. But this page is about best practices as related to software engineering.

I've started an open-source wiki project on GitHub for <a href="https://lorddev.github.io/coding-standards/">standards and practices for software developers</a>, with special consideration given to the issues faced by freelancers who have a lot of projects going on. <i>What are those things almost all of these projects have in common?</i> <i>What principle of this OOP language can we apply in our client-side coding?</i> etc.

Basically, it is a place other than a multi-topic blog where we can catalog all the things we learn from people like Robert C. Martin or Jeff Atwood in one place, debates the merits of each, and promote a level of quality they simply don't teach you in school or in private company standards docs.

If you have some ideas, please ping me, or create some <a href="https://github.com/lorddev/coding-standards/issues">new issues</a> in the project, or you can even clone the repo in Git and edit it yourself!
