I've seen many episodes of <em>Law &amp; Order</em> in which persons in authority or otherwise powerful positions such as authors, preachers, TV &amp; radio personalities, etc., were considered just as responsible as the actual perpetrators who did what they told them to.

My wife found a blog in which a woman was commenting on the Schatz case. This same woman had commented on other cases which bore eerie similarities. Pretty soon, I found more mention of the plastic tubing and the Pearls, and I was able to track down <a href="http://www.nogreaterjoy.org/index.php?id=48&amp;tx_ttnews[tt_news]=93&amp;tx_ttnews[backPid]=28&amp;cHash=557f0a0c46#">this confession</a> from Debi Pearl, direct from the website of the "ministry" that brought you <em>Train Up a Child</em>:
<blockquote>The rod we speak of is a plumbing supply line that can be bought at any hardware store or large department store. It is a slim, flexible, plastic tubing that supplies water to sinks, and toilets. Ask for "¼-inch supply line." They cost less than one dollar. I always give myself one swat before I swat the child to remind myself how much force to exert. It stings the skin without bruising or damaging tissue. It’s a real attention-getter. Michael demonstrates its use in our new Seminar videos.</blockquote>
I've seen other blogs mention the <a href="https://www.salon.com/2006/05/25/the_pearls/">welts</a> and <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.tulipgirl.com/mt/archives/001058.html">bruises</span> this device can leave.

I hope Michael Ramsey finds this.
