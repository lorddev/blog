I figured out a solution to the "all" vs. "any" issue with iTunes Smart Playlists.<br /><br />This is my Reformed Theology playlist.<br /><br /><a href="/assets/img/2011/10/picture2.png"><img src="/assets/img/2011/10/picture2.png?w=300" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />Since the qualifier "any" is applied to all variations, there's no way for me to make sure this list only contains unplayed items, so I have make an effort to remember which ones I listened to already.<br /><br />I found a solution.  Create a new playlist, where the two options are 1) the source playlist to get the files from, and 2) the play count (e.g. 0 for podcasts).<br /><br /><a href="http://mustfollow.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/picture3.png"><img src="http://mustfollow.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/picture3.png?w=300" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />I'm going to use this same methodology for main music rotation playlist, since the iPhone 3.0 software update has messed up the playlist order for Smart Playlists to always go by the "selected by" field.<br /><br /><a href="/assets/img/2011/10/picture4.png"><img src="/assets/img/2011/10/picture4.png?w=300" alt="" border="0" /></a><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src="/itunes-smart-playlist-all-vs-any-issue/"' /></div>
