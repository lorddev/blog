<h2 class="wp-block-heading">PROFILE</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I am a senior C# developer specializing in back-end architecture and RESTful APIs. With experience as a freelancer and an enterprise team member, I am familiar with all stages of the SDLC, and I have experience leading distributed teams. I believe in keeping code well-maintained and keeping up with modern frameworks rather than letting a product stagnate and become obsolete. I have a critical eye for refactoring and optimization. I am a “Boy Scout Coder” who always checks in my code cleaner than it was before.</p>
