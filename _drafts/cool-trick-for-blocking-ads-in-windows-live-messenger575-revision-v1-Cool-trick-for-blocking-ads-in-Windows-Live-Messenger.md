I was offended by an ad I saw on Windows Live Messenger when I logged in to my computer at work this morning.  I tried to uninstall it and use the plain-old Windows Messenger that comes with Windows, but that wouldn't connect to my Yahoo! contacts (which all of my coworkers are on).<br /><br />But then I found <a href="http://uglychickens.blogspot.com/2008/01/block-ads-in-windows-live-messenger.html">this blog entry</a> on Ugly Chickens about how to block those ads with your Hosts file!<br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">[UPDATE: Looks like this technique <a href="http://thenonhacker.deviantart.com/journal/18675053/">works for YIM</a> as well!]</span><div class="blogger-post-footer"></div>
