Then 4 years ago I discovered Flogging Molly and saw my two favorite modern musical genres--Celtic and punk--joined.  And last night, I actually got to play fiddle with a punk band!  <a href="http://www.flatfoot56.com/">Flatfoot 56</a> is out in California on tour from Chicago.  They played Chico on Thursday night, and they let me play with them a little bit at last night's show in Stockton.  Afterwards, they asked me if I'd come down and play with them in Santa Cruz tonight!!!  I can't get too much into details right now because I have to leave pretty soon...<br /><br />(But now, if I ever go to Chicago again, the pizza won't be my only reason!!!)<div class="blogger-post-footer"></div>
