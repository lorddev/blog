The cover story for next week's edition of <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style:italic;">Time Magazine</span> is called "10 Ideas Changing the World Right Now."  Number 3 is "The New Calvinism".<br /><div><br /></div><div>Here are the first and last paragraphs from the article on <a href="http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1884779_1884782_1884760,00.html">time.com</a>:<br /><blockquote>If you really want to follow the development of conservative Christianity, track its musical hits. In the early 1900s you might have heard "The Old Rugged Cross," a celebration of the atonement. By the 1980s you could have shared the Jesus-is-my-buddy intimacy of "Shine, Jesus, Shine." And today, more and more top songs feature a God who is very big, while we are...well, hark the David Crowder Band: "I am full of earth/ You are heaven's worth/ I am stained with dirt/ Prone to depravity."</blockquote>And<br /><blockquote>Calvin's 500th birthday will be this July. It will be interesting to see whether Calvin's latest legacy will be classic Protestant backbiting or whether, during these hard times, more Christians searching for security will submit their wills to the austerely demanding God of their country's infancy.</blockquote><div>Kudos to <a href="http://theologica.blogspot.com/2009/03/time-magazine-new-calvinism-is-changing.html">Justin Taylor</a> for the link (his blog was actually mentioned in the article).</div></div>
