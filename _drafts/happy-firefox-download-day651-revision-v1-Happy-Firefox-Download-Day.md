Today is download day for Firefox 3, the latest version of Mozilla's  awesome web browser.<p>For those of you who don't know, Internet Exploder is rather unstable  and prone to exploits, so when I have to help friends or family fix  their computers after such a malicious attack by spammers or hackers,  I always recommend that they stop using IE and make the switch to the  more secure Firefox.  As <a href="http://www.challies.com/sideblog/archives/2008/06/a_la_carte_617.php">Tim Challies</a> put so well, "If you are still using Internet Explorer, well, it's time to upgrade!."</p><p>Today Mozilla is trying to set a world record for most downloads in a  single day, so get yourself over to <a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/en-US/worldrecord/">www.spreadfirefox.com</a> and get yourself a free copy!</p><p>Sent from my iPhone</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"></div>
