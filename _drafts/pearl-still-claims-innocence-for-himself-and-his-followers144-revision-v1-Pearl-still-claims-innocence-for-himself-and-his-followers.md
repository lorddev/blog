<p>"We do not teach 'corporal punishment' nor 'hitting' children," Michael Pearl said, according to the <em><a href="https://www.paradisepost.com/2010/02/26/questions-about-ministry-grow/" title="">Paradise Post</a></em>. "If indeed these parents were abusive, and that has not yet been proven by the courts, it is regretful that our teachings were not able to turn them from their predisposition to abusive habits..."</p>

<p>I think the quotes various bloggers have been posting from his various works indicate they do, in fact, teach corporal punishment to the point of injury, whether physical, mental, emotional, or even spiritual. He says don't stop, keep going until you break the child's will. Sit on him if you have to. Maybe dude should read his own stuff.</p>
