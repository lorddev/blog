Does your church have one statement of faith for elders and a different one for members?  Are you so sure this is a good idea?<br /><br />Dr. R. Scott Clark writes,<br /><blockquote>It is not obvious that establishing two levels of subscription, one for  laity and another for ordained officers, is either biblical or  consistent with the Reformation.  From where in Scripture would one  deduce that God expects one level of subscription for officers and  another for laity?  Certainly it is possible for one to be a Christian  without affirming every proposition in the Reformed confession, but that  is beside the point.  On that rationale, why should we bother  establishing Reformed congregations at all? If the Reformed confession  defines what it is to be Reformed, then establishing two distinct  relations to the same constitutional document would seem to be a recipe  for confusion and effectively two churches within one.
