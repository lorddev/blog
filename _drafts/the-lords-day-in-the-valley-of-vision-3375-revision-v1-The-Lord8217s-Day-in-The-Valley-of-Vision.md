O LORD,<br />We commune with thee every day,<br />but week days are worldly days,<br />and secular concerns reduce heavenly impressions.<br />We bless thee therefore for the day sacred to our souls<br />when we can wait upon thee and be refeshed;<br />We thank thee for the institutions of religion<br />by use of which we draw near to thee and thou to us;<br />We rejoice in another Lord's Day<br />when we call off our minds from the cares of the world<br />and attend upon thee without distraction;<br />Let our retirement be devout,<br />our conversation edifying,<br />our reading pious,<br />our hearing profitable,<br />that our souls may be quickened and elevated.<br /><br />We are going to the house of prayer,<br />pour upon us the spirit of grace and supplication;<br />We are going to the house of praise,<br />awaken in us every grateful and cheerful emotion;<br />We are going to the house of instruction,<br />give testimony to the Word preached,<br />and glorify it in the hearts of all who hear;<br />may it enlighten the ignorant,<br />awaken the careless, reclaim the wandering,<br />establish the weak, comfort the feeble-minded,<br />make ready a people for their Lord.<br /><br />Be a sanctuary to all who cannot come,<br />Forget not those who never come,<br />And do thou bestow upon us<br />benevolence towards our dependants,<br />forgiveness towards our enemies,<br />peaceableness towards our neighbours,<br />openness towards our fellow-Christians.<br /><br />-- <span style="font-style:italic;">The Valley of Vision</span>
