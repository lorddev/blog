Crossway just released the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/esv-bible/id361797273?mt=8">ESV for the iPhone</a>. I have stuck with their web-based mobile-optimized version because it's better than any of the other native iPhone versions in the app store. But this new one is amazing and elegant.
