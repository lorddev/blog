See here for details: <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/141891/2009/07/google_latitude_iphone.html">http://www.macworld.com/article/141891/2009/07/google_latitude_iphone.html</a><p>The browser-based model is much more in line with Google&#039;s vision, I  <br>think. There are a lot of apps in the app store that would be more  <br>appropriate as web apps. Also, Safari would be able to relay location  <br>to Google with a higher frequency than opening an installed app, since  <br>the apps only run while they are open, and the browser would be active  <br>more often, e.g. when using Google Reader.<div class="blogger-post-footer"></div>
