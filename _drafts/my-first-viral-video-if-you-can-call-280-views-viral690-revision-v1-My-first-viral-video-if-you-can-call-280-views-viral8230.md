Just a while back, I posted a video talking about Mark Driscoll's banned church planting video, and how after I watched it, the Lord convicted me to stop wasting my time playing World of Warcraft, and I started focusing my attention on reading some good theology books, encouraging Pat to take up the mantle of Pastor, spending lots of time with the home group I've been a part of since I moved back to Chico (which I was also a part of before I left!), and learning some old hymns on the guitar; all of this working towards planting our new church, <a href="http://www.sovereignjoycf.org/">Sovereign Joy Christian Fellowship</a>.<br /><br />Last Friday I started noting a rapid increase in the number of views my video was getting.  Now, I know it's only like one-tenth of a percent of the kind of exposure that people like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/Nalts">Nalts</a> or Perez Hilton get, but stillâ€”it's a lot for me!<br /><br />A handful of people from the Mars Hill community in Seattle e-mailed me to thank me for the video, saying it was a great encouragement to them.  Scott Thomas, director of the <a href="http://www.acts29network.org/">Acts 29 Network</a>, was the one who actually journeyed to Florida to bring the ill-fated DVDs to the conference, and he dropped me a short note to tell me my testimony made the whole fiasco worthwhile!<br /><br />Then I got another comment from someone on the video team, who was also very encouraged to hear that the video was actually making an impact somehow.  From this, I figured someone up in Seattle must have been passing my video around, and that must by why I got so many views...  Turns out, Mark Driscoll himself apparently watched it and got a kick out of it, and then he posted a link on their church's private member-only forum!<br /><br />Awesome!  Although I am a little embarrassed now that I know he's seen it, because of all those times I leaned into the camera and said, "This guy's hardcore!"  But it's super encouraging to learn that I'm being an encouragement to them, you know?  It's like a special kind of encouragement that goes both ways, because when they express how encouraged they are, it reciprocates and I am encouraged right back!  This is like a super-cool trick that Jesus designed into the body of Christ that somehow is much too rare these days!<br /><br />You can <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mbm6lDzKH1U">watch it here</a> if you haven't already, and make sure you rate it 5 stars!!!<br /><br />It sure would be nice if the Resurgence would approve it on YouTube page as a video response to the original <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIrIKbCz3n4">Driscoll video</a>.  That's probably how they found out about it in the first place, because I submitted the video as a comment.  But it's not showing up on their page...  Oh well.  God is sovereign!  And it's not about us anyway!<div class="blogger-post-footer"></div>
