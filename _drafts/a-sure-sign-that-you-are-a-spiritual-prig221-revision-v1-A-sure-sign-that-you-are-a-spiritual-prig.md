<blockquote>Beware of allowing yourself to think that the shallow concerns of life are not ordained of God; they are as much of God as the profound. It is not your devotion to God that makes you refuse to be shallow, but your wish to impress other people with the fact that you are not shallow, which is a sure sign that you are a spiritual prig. Be careful of the production of contempt in yourself, it always comes along this line, and causes you to go about as a walking rebuke to other people because they are more shallow than you are. Beware of posing as a profound person; God became a Baby.  (Oswald Chambers, <i>My Utmost for His Highest</i>, Nov. 22)</blockquote><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src="/a-sure-sign-that-you-are-a-spiritual-prig/"' /></div>
