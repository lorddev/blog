<div>Skyhook Wireless is the company that provides the Wi-Fi positioning data that's used by the Google Maps application on the iPhone. So, if you have the first-generation phone that doesn't have GPS, and you want a more accurate "My Location" when you're at home than the cell tower triangulation can give you, you can submit your own Wi-Fi router's MAC address with your coordinates! </div><div><br /></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span"><a href="http://skyhookwireless.com/howitworks/submit_ap.php">http://skyhookwireless.com/howitworks/submit_ap.php</a></span></div>
