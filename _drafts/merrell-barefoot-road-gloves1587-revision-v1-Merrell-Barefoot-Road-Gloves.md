Merrell Barefoot Road Gloves - read the review on barefootrunninguniversity.com

I went to Sports Ltd. on my lunch break and tried these on. At first I was pretty stoked, until I noticed my lateral metatarsal bones sticking out the side of the shoe, hanging over the edge of the outsole. They just don't fit. The Trail Gloves don't have this problem because they have sturdier material on that edge.
