Last month I mentioned the fallout from the Florida church discipline fiasco and subsequent Nine Marks commentary in a post called "<a href="http://mustfollow.blogspot.com/2008/12/church-discipline-called-extortion-by.html">Church Discipline called 'extortion' by Fox News</a>".  Tonight on my way home from work I was listening to <a href="http://webmedia.gty.org/sermons/High/90-370.mp3">a recent message</a> from John MacArthur on church discipline in which he mentioned that the pastor of that church was actually a graduate of <a href="http://www.tms.edu/">The Master's Seminary</a> and a personal friend.  He was discussing how rare it is or churches to practice church discipline these days, even though it is so clearly taught in Scripture.

<div>Grace Community Church in southern California is approaching John MacArthur's 40th anniversary as their pastor, and in recent weeks he has been discussing the biblical foundations that were laid all those years ago.  I recommend subscribing to their <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=295647558">sermon podcast</a>.<br /></div>
