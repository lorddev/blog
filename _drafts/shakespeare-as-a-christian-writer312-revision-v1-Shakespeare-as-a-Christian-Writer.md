Leland Ryken has written an excellent article which is a snapshot of  <br>what he teaches about Shakespeare in his literary courses. You&#039;ll be  <br>pleasantly surprised.  Here&#039;s a quote:<p>"More than conventional: scholars who are attuned to the Christian  <br>element in Shakespeare&#039;s plays correctly observe that there is  <br>sometimes a gratuitous element in Shakespeare&#039;s Christian allusions,  <br>meaning that Shakespeare incorporates Christian references beyond what  <br>seem to be strictly required by the context."<p>You can find it here: <a href="http://www.reformation21.org/articles/shakespeare-as-a-christian-writer.php">http://www.reformation21.org/articles/shakespeare-as-a-christian-writer.php</a><p>I highly recommed reading the whole thing.<p>HT: JT @ <a href="http://theologica.blogspot.com/">http://theologica.blogspot.com/</a><p>Sent from my iPhone<div class="blogger-post-footer"></div>
