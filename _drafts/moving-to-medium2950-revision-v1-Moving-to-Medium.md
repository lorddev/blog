<p>After all the <a href="https://www.404media.co/wordpress-checkbox-login-wp-engine/">shenanigans over at WordPress</a>, I've decided to start publishing on Medium. <a href="https://medium.devlord.io/subscribe">You can follow me there if you like</a>. I have 15 subscribers here, so I'll probably be importing you over there after the waiting period is over. I don't know yet all the ins-and-outs of how Medium works so hopefully it doesn't require you to pay to read my stuff! (Update: I think it only does this if the author chooses to monetize, which I won't. If you discover otherwise, email me please. I can send gift links.)</p>
