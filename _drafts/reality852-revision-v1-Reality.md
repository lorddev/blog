"For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God." Rom 3:23 (ESV, NIV, NKJV, etc.)<br /><br />All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.  But I'm not used to looking like I need His grace so much.  I'm used to looking like I pretty much have it all together.  But I don't.  None of us do.<br /><br />"All the pleading which deliberately refuses to recognize the Cross is of no avail; it is battering at another door than the one which Jesus has opened.  I don't want to come that way, it is too humiliating to be received as a sinner."  (Oswald Chambers, <i>My Utmost for His Highest</i>, <a href="http://www.gospelcom.net/rbc/utmost/12/08/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dec 8</a>).<br /><br />Good morning, welcome to reality!<div class="blogger-post-footer"></div>
