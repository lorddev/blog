Hollie's art studio. We had an acoustic jam session up there on the porch on Saturday night.

I got to hang with Gabe &amp; Shannon (Nina, too) at the Calabasas Starbucks, and then we went to John's Garden. You can probably tell his camera's a lot better than mine! :-)

Brian &amp; Hollie Tieleman. Great friends I've known for 10 years!

These are Mike &amp; Denise Radka. Their wedding in Oxnard last September was a divinely-orchestrated reunion. I still have the thank-you letters they wrote me for playing at it--awesome words of encouragement!

Brian &amp; Stuckey (Chris) by the fence. Thanks so much for bringing the pipes!

Brian &amp; Leslie Moon. They went to Scotland with me (so did Stuckey, and Mike &amp; Denise), and I think Leslie was even on the Highlands team for Prayerstorm. Davy, Joy, and Dougie, who were also there, have also been to Scotland with me, though I somehow failed to get pictures of them this weekend... If anyone else did, please e-mail them to me!

Dang! My throat hurts! Must be all that smog I inhaled on the freeway the day before...

I love Erik &amp; Linda! We had a really good chat, mostly about how important friendship is to a relationship (duh!!!). But they have a better digital camera, so I need to get them to e-mail me the one I took with their camera.

Beautiful sunset over the Sheen-Richards residence.

Sometimes I get to sleep on that bed on the porch.

The garden by the fire pit.
