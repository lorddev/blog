In keeping with the theme of refuting dispensationalism, I wanted to post this link to an<a href="http://www.graceonlinelibrary.org/eschatology/is-the-pretribulation-rapture-biblical-by-brian-schwertley/"> article about the secret rapture theory</a> from a Reformed Baptist perspective, written by Brian Schwertley in 1999. He writes,
<blockquote>Whenever a Christian encounters a doctrine that has not been taught by anyone in any branch of Christ’s church for over eighteen centuries, one should be very suspect of that teaching. This fact in and of itself does not prove that the new teaching is false. But, it should definitely raise one’s suspicions, for if something is taught in Scripture, it is not unreasonable to expect at least a few theologians and exegetes to have discovered it before. The teaching of a secret pretribulation rapture is a doctrine that never existed before 1830...</blockquote>
