So I wasn't able to get up early enough to see the launch live yesterday.  I thought I had my alarm set on snooze so it would go back off after 5 minutes, but I guess I didn't.  I was able to view clips online and on the news later, but it's not quite the same.  I might have missed my last chance ever to see the space shuttle take off.  It's not looking good for the space shuttle program.  According to <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20050728/ap_on_sc/space_shuttle/nc:2117;_ylt=Ap52JBr3XqKSbw9Akucu3SmHgsgF;_ylu=X3oDMTBiMW04NW9mBHNlYwMlJVRPUCUl">this AP news story</a>, the shuttle fleet is grounded until further notice because of this insulating-foam-chunks-always-breaking-off issue that apparently still haunts NASA.<div class="blogger-post-footer"></div>
