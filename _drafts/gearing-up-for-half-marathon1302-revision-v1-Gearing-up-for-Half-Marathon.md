The half-marathon for which I've been training for the last 6 months is tomorrow. I've decided to go ahead and run in my old Saucony Kinvara 2's. They are well worn-in, and I don't remember ever cursing their very existence after a long run <a href="/2012/02/19/mr10-runners-world-editors-choice/">the way I did</a> the MR10's after a 12.6-er a couple weeks ago. I still feel the MO10s are the world's best shoe, honestly. But it's been a couple months since I've done a long run in them, and I don't remember how I felt about them for long distances. Besides, they're the winterized model, and it's going to be much to warm for them at start time (50Â° F and sunny).
