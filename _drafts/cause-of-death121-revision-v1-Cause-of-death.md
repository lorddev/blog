Action news <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.khsltv.com/content/localnews/story/New-information-on-alleged-beating-death-of/jbF3C2lmaUimUdY16v5x6A.cspx">reported</span> tonight that the coroner's report was released today.  The medical examiner confirmed Lydia Schatz died from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhabdomyolysis">rhabdomyolysis</a> resulting from the torture and abuse she suffered at the hands of her parents, who whipped their children with 1/4" plumbing supply line because it was endorsed by fundamentalist preacher Michael Pearl as the biblical "rod" most appropriate for chastening your children.

Today is Lydia's 8th birthday.  Happy birthday, little one.
