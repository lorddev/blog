I just want to give a shout out to <a href="http://www.nextmill.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Millennium Systems</a>, my web hosts to whom I refer all of my clients.  They were extremely helpful in getting directory permissions and Perl modules set up in order for me to be able to run this blog.  I must say, I've been doing web programming for 6 years, and their technical support is the best in the business!  Thanks, guys!<br /><br /><b>Update:</b> I've since migrated my blog from hosted MovableType to Google's Blogger platform. But I still need to thank my web hosts for moving things around on their servers to make the MT version accessible to me so I could perform the export!
