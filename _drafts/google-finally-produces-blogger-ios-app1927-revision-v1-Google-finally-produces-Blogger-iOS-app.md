This is a long time coming. But it might just be way too late. Unfortunately, it's not a universal app also optimized for iPad, so I'm not going to be getting rid of BlogPress anytime soon. You can get the new Blogger app from the app store.<br /><br />P.S. I used it to post this.<br />P.P.S. The location feature is better than BlogPress's.<br />P.P.P.S. Or not... It's cooler in the UI where you select it, but it doesn't actually append anything to your post.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Z5DtHYpz86I/TnJN5vhjboI/AAAAAAAAJ_U/0Hh2G49jrnE/s640/blogger-image-654744342.jpg" style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Z5DtHYpz86I/TnJN5vhjboI/AAAAAAAAJ_U/0Hh2G49jrnE/s640/blogger-image-654744342.jpg" /></a></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='' alt='' /></div>
