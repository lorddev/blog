Just a quick note to say I finally found the charger for the old Nikon 5400 I bought from <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rev_411photography/">James</a>, and I also found a USB sync cable on eBay. All this just in time for the pending birth of our son. (<span style="font-style:italic;">Yeah right</span>, she says, <span style="font-style:italic;">he's never coming out</span>.) So you will likely see some more pictures from us soon.
