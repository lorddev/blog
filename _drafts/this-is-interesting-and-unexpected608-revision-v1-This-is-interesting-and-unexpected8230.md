I was trying to turn off my iPhone using the old-fashioned method, both buttons at the same time, the way you used to do it in 1.0.  But instead, the screen flickered.  When I next synced with iPhoto, there were a bunch of screen captures in there!  Apparently in 2.0, the method you used to use to bring up the off switch is now the way you take screen shots!<br /><br /><div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_OZWxOfjIgdA/SIBBwoAK2MI/AAAAAAAAADY/DdRiC_1_Kws/s1600-h/IMG_0001.PNG"><img src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_OZWxOfjIgdA/SIBBwoAK2MI/AAAAAAAAADY/DdRiC_1_Kws/s400/IMG_0001.PNG" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='' alt='' /></div>
