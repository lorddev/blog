<p>Remember when Trump visited the town of "Pleasure" (our town's name is Paradise, which also starts with the letter P and means something intrinsically nice) after the Camp Fire in 2018?</p>

<p>Well, apparently he did a background check on us first.</p>

<p>Mark Harvey, who was Trump’s senior director for resilience policy on the National Security Council staff, told E&amp;E News on Wednesday that Trump initially refused to approve disaster aid for California after deadly wildfires in 2018 [e.g. the Camp Fire] because of the state’s Democratic leanings.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Harvey said Trump changed his mind after Harvey pulled voting results to show him that heavily damaged Orange County, California, had more Trump supporters than the entire state of Iowa.</p>

<p>Thank goodness for the O.C. I doubt Trump would have cared enough to do research into little old Butte County.</p>
