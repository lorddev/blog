<h1>Clichés are so cliché&#8230;</h1>

<p class="view">by Aaron Lord</p>

<p>I was watching the <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=115624496">ABC World News Webcast</a> on my <a href="http://www.apple.com/appletv/">Apple TV</a> and <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/story?id=127316">David Muir</a> keeps using the phrase “sea change”. I couldn’t figure out what he was talking about, so I <a href="http://www.google.com/">Googled</a> “see change” and “seed change”. My “seed change” <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=seed+change&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a">query</a> turned up a <a href="http://www.petrifiedtruth.com/archives/002107.html">blog</a> that linked to an interesting <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/extra/?id=110005925">article</a> by famous sci-fi author <a href="http://www.raybradbury.com/">Ray Bradbury</a> complaining about how we have become frozen with our concrete freeways and have lost our imagination about <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/exploration/main/index.html">exploring space</a>. Finally, I discovered that “seed change” is an <a href="http://eggcorns.lascribe.net/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=2283">eggcorn</a> for “sea change”, which is a cliché inspired by a passage from Shakespeare’s <a href="http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/errors/sea.html"><em>Tempest</em></a> in which good-old <a href="http://www.bardweb.net/">Willy</a> was simply describing what happens to someone when they’ve been in the water for a long time (as in dead, with <a href="http://www.eternalreefs.com/">coral growing on your bones</a>, etc.). Please, people, can’t we think of more creative, original ways to express ourselves?</p>
