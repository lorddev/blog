<p>Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP</code></p>

<p>Where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR</code> is a four-digit number, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MONTH</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DAY</code> are both two-digit numbers, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MARKUP</code> is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>

<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>I'm currently going through a bunch of old notes. Since Evernote raised prices and locked down free accounts a long time ago, I've tried importing them to Notion, and today I imported to Apple Notes. But most of my note-taking is for work, and I need screenshots on Windows for that, and Apple Notes via the web interface has no rich formatting or image pasting. I'm considering Obsidian and have yet to find a screenshot markup tool that I like. I loved Skitch and it's pink arrows, but again, it's been enshittified by Evernote. But I found the below draft in Byword, a markdown app I used to use, dated Nov. 3, 2012. With the 2024 election upon us, and the war in Palestine and its vicinity, I thought it poignant.</p>

<p>I am aware, after further research, that some of the statements regarding the rise of dispensationalism are overly-simplified, as it did not begin in the '70s, but that's definitely when it took over evangelicalism.</p>

<p>In many ways I think that Calvary Chapel and the movement it was part of the 1970s is responsible for the current right wing religious fanaticism that is engulfing country.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before the Jesus People movement, nobody but the Seventh-Day Adventists thought the apocalypse was upon us.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But now, the urgency that's placed upon all arguments is heightened to the point of life-and-death. This is why the GOP battle cry in congress is "No Compromise!" The Christian fanatics in Washington actually believe their counterparts accross the aisle are possessed by demons.</p>

<p>Seven or eight years ago I ceased to be a premillenarian. As I made that transition it helped me see how insane it was to allow free and uncondemned practice of millenialists in our society. A good picture of the societal effects of millenialists vs amillenarians can be seen simply in their buildings. Amillenialists' buildings are typically over a hundred yeara old, made out of stone or brick, materials meant to last for generations. Premillenialists often worship in storefronts or movie theaters. The same goea with polity, as churches like Calvary Chapel fail to raise up successors as they typically believe Jesus will come back before their pastor gets old. People fail to save for their childrens' college education (I went to school on a mixture of scholarship and student loans and am still making payments 20 years later. And not one of my 10 neices and nephews has been to school a single day in his/her life, and their parents don't bother trying to find a successful career.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If 44% of the nation lives this way because of their crazy eschatology, it's no wonder the GOP wants to cut social security and medicare and education. It also explains crazy pro-Israeli policies.</p>

<p>Sarah McCammon is an NPR journalist who was assigned to cover the Trump campaign in 2016. <em>The Exvangelicals</em> is part memoir and part reporting about that state of the church and why so many are leaving. I identified with the book all the way through, as I grew up in the church as well and left for similar reasons, though mine involved actual conflict rather than a quiet departure.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The author begins with reflection about growing up in the church, and describes the religious trauma that comes when you worry that when you prayed the sinner’s prayer when you were a few years younger didn’t “count.” “I didn't think I felt any different, and I wondered how I could know for sure that I was saved, that God had definitely heard my prayer. So, two years later, I asked my mom to help me pray it again, just to be safe.” p. 21</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nights laying awake in bed, worrying about your soul and those of your loved ones…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fear of hell, and worrying about assurance of salvation are examples of trauma that’s not inflicted by an external abuser, but just comes from being part of the religion and growing up reading the Bible every day. Then there is the particular dispensational eschatology (doctrine of the end times) taught from many pulpits. “There was still so much to fear. We lived each day with the knowledge that Jesus could come back at any time… If, and only if, we were ready, Jesus would take us up with him, into the clouds. ‘The trumpet shall sound,’ the verse from Matthew promised… The sound of a train whistle, or a loud car horn, was enough to send me into a panic…” pp.22-23</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chapters 5 and 6 deal with science denialism and the “alternative facts” that fly in the face of the fight against “relativism” which Christians have fought for so long. Is truth true or is it not?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“To compromise our understanding of the literal truth of the Bible in any way, we were told, could threaten everything. If there was no direct creation in the Garden of Eden, and no literal Adam, did that mean there was no sin? And if not, then why did Jesus come to save us? We knew we were sinners and he'd come to save us, so there must have been an Adam and there must have been a garden.” (p. 64) If the Garden of Eden didn’t happen, what then is the premise for Jesus dying on the cross?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We were taught to bring “every thought captive to Christ”… “For many evangelicals, the expectation to constantly be comparing what was learned and observed from the outside world with evangelical teachings eventually created an insurmountable cognitive dissonance.” p. 71</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>McCammon talks about conspiracy thinking and Trumpism and the hypocritical juxtaposition of the way Evangelicals treated President Bill Clinton compared to how they glorify Donald Trump.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The middle of the book is about purity culture, including sections on LBGTQ+ issues and abortion. Chaste courtship is taught, and then, once you are fruitful and multiply, Evangelicals then require you to use the rod of discipline on your progeny.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She mentions Michael and Debi Pearl, who treat spanking as a sacrament. In my own town, a decade ago, a child died at her parents’ hands as they followed Pearl’s spanking manual verbatim. I used to go to church with these people, and it breaks my heart that we were ill-equipped to recognize the red flags. She then shares stories of exvangelicals brought up in this way choosing to listen to their intuition about how treating an infant as a sinner is wrong, and hitting them is, too.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The author then digs into all the specific religious traumas associated with evangelicalism: the fear of being left behind in the Rapture and facing beheading during the Great Tribulation, the body shame caused by purity culture, the incapacitating fear of hell and eternity, and financial stress related to tithing. These experiences often lead to a profound sense of disconnection—from oneself, from others, from the outside world, and, I would add, from living in the present moment and planning for a real future as opposed to a pretend one. Chronic stress is instilled at a young age. This even has effects in the nervous system similar to PTSD.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So many of us have chosen to walk away from the hypocrisy of the evangelical church. Now where do we go from here? For evangelicals, church is their entire life. How can you walk away from that?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Perhaps not surprisingly, a 2022 survey published by the American Enterprise Institute found that while evangelicalism has for years enjoyed one of the lowest disaffiliation rates for people raised in any faith, those who leave report feeling lonely or isolated at higher rates than people who’d left other faiths. (p. 220)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How do we get along, if we can, with our Trump-supporting parents? Boomers who have tried to bring up their kids following the advice of evangelical powerhouses like Focus on the Family, see their exvangelical children as backsliders living a sinful lifestyle. As D.L. Mayfield says, “People don’t have the emotional energy anymore to lie to their parents to get love and acceptance, and to get a slightly less awkward holiday.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We have to find community somehow, and for many of us that has come in online spaces as we’ve discovered others with shared experiences. There was a thriving exvangelical community on Twitter, but I deleted my account when Elon Musk took over. I’ve looked for the same thing on Mastodon and Threads (it’s not quite there on Bluesky, or I haven’t found it yet). There are a couple Discord servers I like, but it’s not the same. Being able to gripe to internet strangers about things doesn’t have quite the same effect as calling your closest friends for support.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once a member of my family told me I was going to hell. I don’t talk to him anymore. But now I wear the title “apostate” as a badge of honor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There’s probably nothing more aggravating than the typical evangelical response to the deconstruction movement: that we weren’t saved to begin with or that we are backsliding and choosing to live a worldly life.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The idea that people leave evangelicalism out of nothing more than a desire to "sin" is frustrating to many of the people I interviewed—and to me. People with little investment in the church are likely to simply walk away, like someone ghosting a party they didn't really feel like going to. But for those of us who took it seriously—who read the apologetics books, did our devotionals, and prayed for clarity—being told to try harder to make all the puzzle pieces fit together feels like a deliberate refusal to truly listen. (p. 239-240)</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We gave our lives to the church, spending 12+ hours every Sunday serving, playing music, running sound or Powerpoint. Then Tuesday night home fellowship and Wednesday night youth group. Street witnessing or going door-to-door to invite people to church. Reading the Bible through every year. We didn’t give up without a fight. Leaving the church was something we agonized over. After so much sacrifice, it hurts to just be dismissed as if we never counted and nothing we did even mattered.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On July 24, 2024, at Upper Park in Chico, California, a man set his car on fire and pushed it off a 60-foot embankment. The dry vegetation around it was quickly engulfed in flames and the fire spread rapidly, climbing the ridge into the forest and eventually growing over 400,000 acres, reaching all the way to Shasta County. Because it started in the park, they named it the Park Fire.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>(The photo above is a still from a video I took in our front yard in Paradise, in the footprint of the 2018 Camp Fire which destroyed the town, including our previous home on the same lot.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My daughter was only 9 at the time of the Camp Fire. She assured us she wasn't traumatized. But as soon as the smoke from the Park Fire was visible, she started packing her things and filling up the cars so much there wasn't room for anyone else's belongings. We were all clearly exhibiting PTSD.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Friday night an evacuation warning ensued for the whole town of Paradise. Worried that it would change from a warning to an order overnight, I sent my wife and the kids ahead to my mother-in-law's house and stayed behind with the dog, who doesn't do well around strangers. I spent the next day trying to negotiate an Airstream purchase from dealers in the Bay area and 8 hours away in Portland, but the dealers would close for the next two days and wanted a down payment that was higher than what we had on hand. Fortunately an old work buddy reached out and offered a place to stay near his vineyard in Placerville. So we consolidated our luggage and the dog into one vehicle and went down for a few days until the evacuation warning was lifted.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yes, I understand it was "just" a "warning", but when the Camp Fire happened, we didn't get a warning at all.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>(We've decided to pursue the Airstream purchase in the near future regardless, since we seem to always need one on an emergency basis, and will need one for retirement anyways.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A couple days after we returned home, <a href="https://mikethompson.house.gov/newsroom/press-releases/thompson-releases-statement-senate-republicans-blocking-tax-relief-wildfire" title="">Senate Republicans blocked a bill</a> that had been pending since January, which would have allowed tax refunds for Camp Fire victims whose settlement monies were cut in half by lawyer fees and taxes. In response, a bunch of Camp Fire victims got on Facebook and actually blamed the Democrats for adding "pork" to the bill that would help so-called "illegals." I quoted Leviticus 19 to them and quickly logged out. I don't understand why people can be so violently opposed to policies that are in their own best interest. I suppose this is the story of the American working class.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For more details on the fire, the crew over at <a href="https://app.watchduty.org/i/27638" title="">Watch Duty </a>has been a great resource. The app has proved invaluable for keeping tabs on the evacuation details and the progress the firefighters are making.</p>

<p><em>Saving Darwin</em> by theistic evolutionist Karl Giberson. In this work, Giberson shows that the current creationist crusade is uniquely American (most European or even Canadian theists don't have a problem with science), and proves that the modern creationist movement was directly started by the Seventh Day Adventists in the 19th century, as they believed their prophetess to have received direct revelations from God in which he showed that everything literally happened exactly as portrayed in Genesis, about 6,000 years ago. SDA is a particularly unorthodox sect. (Up to this point, most people accepted the lessons learned from Copernicus, that if the Bible says the sun rises and sets, it doesn't follow that our scientific observations of the solar system are merely illusory.)</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jerry Coyne, <em>Why Evolution Is True</em>. Once you've established the shady origins of the fundamentalist crusade you need to do some research on modern evolutionary science. Coyne doesn't like theists (even ones who accept evolution), and will thereby force some internal confrontation.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once you’ve processed these it’s probably a good idea to educate yourself on the source with Darwin’s <em>The Origin of Species</em>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Confronting Scriptural inerrancy</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's one thing to accept that the first part of Genesis is a sort of poetic literary thing not meant to be taken literally. It's quite another to confront the nature of Scripture as a whole. For this, we will take:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the Old Testament, <em>Some Mistakes of Moses</em> (1880) by the eloquent and esteemed Robert G. Ingersoll.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the New, Bart Ehrman's <em>Misquoting Jesus</em>, which is geared particularly to those who care about exegesis, especially Protestants who believe in the Reformation cry "Sola Scriptura". He shatters all ideas about the inspiration of Scripture using manuscript evidence to show how the texts were manipulated during the formation of the Christian canon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Attack of the New Atheists</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once we have confronted the evidence against the doctrines of inspiration and&nbsp;inerrancy, we are still left open to the possibility that the traditions of the Catholic church have preserved the true Christian faith apart from Scripture. Of course, this is laughable in this day an age of popes resigning and bishops covering up for perverted priests who abuse helpless children. But just in case there be any doubt...</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>God Is Not Great</em> by Christopher Hitchens. An amazing work that might make you feel like all these things should have been more obvious.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Daniel Dennett’s <em>Breaking the Spell</em>, which explores the evolutionary development of religion—that religions are "natural" phenomenon, which evolve just like art, music, architecture, etc.,&nbsp;and ought to help a Christian see that there's nothing particular divine or revelatory about the tradition we have received.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A Universal Morality</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In case Hitchens doesn’t provide enough grounds for morality apart from Scripture, there is also <em>Atheism</em> by Julian Baggini, which contains a large section about ethics.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Morality is more than possible without God, it is entirely independent of him. That means atheists are not only more than capable of leading moral lives, they may even be able to lead more moral lives than religious believers who confuse divine law and punishment with right and wrong.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And A.C. Grayling’s <em>The God Argument</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are many sound reasons why we should seek to live responsibly, with generosity and sympathy towards others, with care and affection for them, and with continence, sound judgement and decency in our own lives. We can see the value of these things in themselves, and from the point of the benefits they bring society and its individual members, including ourselves.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Confronting the Universe</h2>

<p>I don’t talk about it much, especially as time has passed and I’ve moved on with my life, but 25 years ago I was in a band. We recorded a demo, and then the lead singer signed a record contract. We changed our name and re-recorded the demo material along with some new songs for the album release.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The reason I don’t talk much about this is that it was a bad breakup. Three other band members were axed for supposedly not keeping up their chops. Then I went on a missions trip to Scotland and Ireland for a couple weeks. When I got back they told me they were going to start the tour without me but would call when they got the funding for a fifth musician. They never called. Imagine my surprise when I saw them on the Late Late Show with a mystery keyboard player I had never seen before. It sent me into a depression, compounded by the professional problem of the time, known as the “Dot-Com Bubble Burst,” which quickly devoured the startup where I worked.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As part of my quest to identify what went wrong, I bought a copy of <em>All You Need to Know about the Music Business</em> and discovered two fundamentals which I encourage every young aspiring musician to heed: 1) contracts, and 2) sign with the label as a band, not just the lead singer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My advice to young bands: If you’re in a situation like we were in, where one or two members need improvement to recapture what they recorded in the studio in a live setting, just take a time-out: give them some of the record company’s money so they can skip work and buckle down and practice without worrying about how to make rent or put food on the table.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wouldn’t be where I am today with my family and lovely home had things gone differently. As a step on my healing journey I finally decided to request one of those things musicians like to hang on their walls.</p>

<p>I was a Calvinist before I became an atheist. I was <em>very</em> Calvinist, in fact. It got to the point where I had eventually achieved such a robust Reformation theology that I accepted the idea that God could actually choose to send me to hell for eternity. I figured if it were to happen, it would be because God had determined in his divine will that it would bring him the most glory, and I was cool with that. But that was also kind of a wake-up call.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I think I stopped believing in hell before I stopped believing in heaven.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the late 1990s and early 2000s the emergent movement started gaining traction among young-adults, college goups, small groups. I was not into it. Brian MacLaren... I wasn't into it. Donald Miller... His first hit was interesting but not profound, but his second really got me. Rob Bell on the other hand...</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He wrote something along the lines of, "What if someone finds through DNA evidence that Jesus was not born of a virgin. What if that doctrine is just one spring on the trampoline and it were removed—Could a person keep on jumping?" Many in the church immediately labelled Bell a heretic just for asking the hypothetical question (and this was years before he denied the doctrine of hell).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, the prophecy of Isaiah 7:14 does not say in the original Hebrew that "A virgin will conceive…" It says literally, "A young woman of marriageable age will conceive..." (Heb. <em>almah</em>).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rob Bell's book <em>Love Wins</em> came out back in 2012. I had a different reaction to it than I did to reading <em>The Velvet Elvis</em>. Though I didn't read <em>Love Wins</em>, I read quoted excerpts, and I became quite familiar with it through the evangelical backlash. The reaction was bigger than the book itself, I think. (It's ironic how un-Christian many Christians can behave when someone disagrees with them.) Our former mainline, Princeton-educated Presbyterian pastor had said once that he felt that if Rob Bell had been a Presbyterian he might have received a nicer/calmer reaction to his theories from his “constituency”.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some Christians actually rethought their views and came to rediscover the views of John Stott and other annihilationists. But even fundamentalist fire-and-brimstone Christians already don't mind annihilationism, as long as it's for other species. When you flush your fish down the toilet or your cat gets hit by a car, or you have to bring your old sick dog to the vet to be put down, you have no problem explaining annihilationism to your children.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But most Christians refuse to accept annihilation for <em>H. sapiens</em> (at least not for the "saved" ones.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If Jesus only died for Adam's descendants, it doesn't seem quite fair for <a href="https://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-fossils/species/homo-floresiensis">Hobbits</a>, Neanderthals, or Denisovans. If you expand to scope of the atonement to all humans, then you have to accept the salvation of chimpanzees, as well (Linnaeus originally classified chimps as genus <em>Homo</em>, and genetic studies about 10 years ago also recommended the reclassification). Let's say you go ahead and admit the salvation of chimps. By observation, the lives and experiences of chimps are not much different in terms of mental and social complexity from the lives of the other higher apes. If you accept the salvation of chimps, then you also have to accept the personhood of all the great apes, and join the likes of Jane Goodall in fighting for animal rights.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But if you accept the salvation of apes, then your doctrine of The Fall and Original Sin goes out the window entirely, unless you consider Adam and Eve to be common ancestors to all apes. And really, they’d have to be, since the DNA bottleneck for humans was never smaller than 1,280. So much for the Flood and Noah’s Ark.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The fact is, there is no such thing as hell. Even the Anglican church knows this. As A.C. Grayling writes in <em>The God Argument</em>: “[A] decision of the Anglican Church in a 1996 Synod shed the doctrine of hell as a place of eternal punishment for sinners, redescribing hell as ‘the absence of God’ and saying that the punishment for very bad people is annihilation.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the New Testament, Gehenna was an actual place outside the city where they burned trash, and Jesus liked to use it as a metaphor. He speaks of a place of eternal fire prepared for demons, but then he says,</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->

<p>For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink, I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me. ...Whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><cite>Matthew 25:42-43, 45 (NIV)</cite></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two things here: 1) it was a parable, and 2) it’s about social justice. If you don’t do social justice, Jesus tells you to go to hell. Not literally. That’s not the point. The point is to take care of your neighbor as you’d take care of Jesus if he were among us. Otherwise your worth to him is rubbish.</p>

<p>These words were penned 10 years ago. I never got around to blogging them because blogging was out of fashion at the time, in favor of micro-blogging platforms such as Twitter (R.I.P.) and due to other distractions in life. But it illustrates a step on my thought journey. Dated March 26, 2014.</p>

<p>I am an agnostic Jesus-follower. That is, science and reason tell me that Yahweh, even if he existed, was a murderous tyrant, and so if Christians teach that Jesus was the son of Yahweh, or that Jesus believed he was doing the will of Yahweh,  or that Yahweh raised Jesus from the dead, that these claims must be false.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, inasmuch as we can verify that Jesus was an anti-establishment revolutionary who preached social justice, healed the sick, condemned the rich, and promoted the Golden Rule like Buddha and Isocrates before him, then this is a man who inspires me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So many today,  especially in conservative Reformed circles, tend to emphasize “cristus victor” over the real Jesus. That is, Christ glorified, the King of heaven, who will come back to judge the quick and the dead. As such they value the theological teachings of the new Testament—which were written decades after his death, rather than  the actual words of Christ, which were supposedly passed from Cephas and James the brother of Jesus straight to Paul and recorded by Q and Mark within their lifetimes (debatable, and probably false)—before Christological developments of later years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Christ enthroned condemns the world and inspires wars. The actual human Jesus was a man of compassion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The heavenly Jesus inspires the GOP to promote an American theocracy and stir up Israeli wars in Palestine in order to hasten the return of Christ. The living Jesus said "the kingdom is among you".</p>

<p>As Bart Ehrman says, “There is no way to be certain that these sayings actually go back to the historical Jesus.” But for consistency, a believer ought to lift up Jesus’ own teachings over the later theological developments. It is amazing that my thoughts about wars in Palestine are still as apt today, and it’s just getting worse. If we can’t persuade Christians to reject religion, we need to at least persuade them to take the teachings of Jesus seriously.</p>
