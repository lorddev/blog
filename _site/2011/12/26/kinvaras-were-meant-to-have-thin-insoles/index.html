<h1>Kinvaras Were Meant to Have Thin Insoles</h1>

<p class="view">by Aaron Lord</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/20111226-120702.jpg"><img class="size-full aligncenter" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/20111226-120702.jpg" alt="20111226-120702.jpg" width="695" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>My children have a tendency to get into things and move things around. As a result, the original insoles for my Saucony Kinvara 2 running shoes have been sitting in plain sight for a few days. It suddenly dawned on me how thin they were compared to the spongy insoles I had replaced them with on the advice of my physical therapist, and I realized my judgment of the shoes was made based on the insoles Saucony didn’t intend them to be worn with. So I switched them back out, and it makes all the difference.</p>

<p>No offense to my PT, but he was wrong.</p>

<p>The toe box is suddenly much roomier. Because my feet sit much lower in the upper than with the thick insoles, I have to tighten the laces, and this has re-shaped the last. I now see what the associate at the running store meant when she said it was a good last for my feet. My metatarsals still push out on the sides a bit, but this is now minimized, as the shoes are shaped differently width-wise as my feet are now several millimeters lower in them. They also run much better on these Paradise hills. The heel-to-toe ratio is improved with the original thinner insoles, so it’s much easier to land on the balls of my feet.</p>

<p>I’ve put almost 300 miles on these shoes, which is more than I expected when I noticed the sponginess of the upper. With the original insoles, I’ll be able to get a few dozen more out of them (and if I had replaced them sooner, I’d have prettier toenails!).</p>

<p>I still think the outsoles are thicker than they ought to be, as I’d prefer to sit lower to the ground as I run. And I don’t like the funny way they splay out at a 45° angle (they feel like snowshoes in that way). But they now come in 3rd place of favorite running shoes, and if I could find some on clearance, I’d even keep them in stock to help extend the lifespan of the other shoes in my rotation.</p>
