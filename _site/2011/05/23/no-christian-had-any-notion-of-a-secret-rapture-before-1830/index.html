<p>In keeping with the theme of refuting dispensationalism, I wanted to post this link to an<a href="http://www.graceonlinelibrary.org/eschatology/is-the-pretribulation-rapture-biblical-by-brian-schwertley/"> article about the secret rapture theory</a> from a Reformed Baptist perspective, written by Brian Schwertley in 1999. He writes,</p>
<blockquote>Whenever a Christian encounters a doctrine that has not been taught by anyone in any branch of Christ’s church for over eighteen centuries, one should be very suspect of that teaching. This fact in and of itself does not prove that the new teaching is false.
