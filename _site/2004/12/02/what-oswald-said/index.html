<h1>What Oswald Said&#8230;</h1>

<p class="view">by Aaron Lord</p>

<p>This is what got the wheels cranking in my mind to write that article about <a href="https://www.devlord.io/blog/2004/12/01/choosing-gods-will/">Choosing God’s Will</a>:<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;God never coerces us.  In one mood we wish He would make us do the thing, and in another mood we wish He would leave us alone.  Whenever God’s will is in the ascendant, all compulsion is gone.  When we choose deliberately to obey Him, then He will tax the remotest star and the last grain of sand to assist us with all His almighty power.  (Oswald Chambers, <i> My Utmost for His Highest</i>, <a href="http://www.gospelcom.net/rbc/utmost/12/01/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dec. 1</a>)&lt;/blockquote&gt;<b>Update:</b> This is not how I feel anymore. I think I was in the middle of arguing with friends who had become Calvinists around this time, and was looking for straws to grasp.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</p>
