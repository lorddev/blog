<p>Christians are so uncool.  At least <i>Rolling Stone</i> thinks so.  They were going to run a story about down &amp; dirty street ministry on the Spanish island of Ibiza, but <i>RS</i> pulled the story, because apparently they’re <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/_/id/6635544" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mad at Christians</a> for getting Bush re-elected.  In their response, the brothers and sisters at 24-7prayer.com said:<br /><br />&lt;blockquote&gt;The good news is that 24-7 is now officially out of tune with the spirit of the age, (and <i>Rolling Stone</i> is about as Official as you can get on these things). THIS IS GREAT NEWS! It means that, while we are culturally present enough to be on the radar of mainstream interest, we remain culturally <i>irrelevant</i> enough to be considered alternative and subversive which is EXACTLY where we need to be.
