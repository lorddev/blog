That’s okay, I don’t like Evanescence anyway. Your sound and your music have to happen because it’s what’s inside you, not because it’s what’s trendy, marketable, and profitable.

<p>In a (11/14) <em>New York Times</em> interview before the new album’s release, Bono said:</p>
<blockquote>There's cathedrals and the alleyway in our music. I think the alleyway is usually on the way to the cathedral, where you can hear your own footsteps and you're slightly nervous and looking over your shoulder and wondering if there's somebody following you. And then you get there and you realize there was somebody following you: It's God.</blockquote>
