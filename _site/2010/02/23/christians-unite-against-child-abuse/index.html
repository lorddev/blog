        <p>This is what Scripture says:</p>
<blockquote>Truly I say to you, unless you are converted and become like children, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven. Whoever then humbles himself as this child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. And whoever receives one such child in My name receives Me; but whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to stumble, it would be better for him to have a heavy millstone hung around his neck, and to be drowned in the depth of the sea. (Matthew 18:3-6, NASB)</blockquote>
<p>Our Lord says child abuse and filicide are not merely life-or-death issues; they are much more, for they may affect the eternal state of one’s soul.</p>

<p>For this reason, as Salon <a href="https://www.salon.com/2010/02/23/no_greater_joy/">reports</a>, Christians are finally starting to speak out against so-called “biblical” child abuse.</p>

<p>Paul <a href="http://ticklemebrahms.blogspot.com/2010/02/in-which-i-talk-about-terrible-event-i.html">speaks out</a>:</p>
<blockquote>If you call yourself a Christian and you don't immediately think it's a foul, unthinkable, disgusting suggestion to whip your child at least 10 times per offense (more "if needed"), wearing the weapon visibly at all times, having a weapon always at hand with which to whip your child, menacingly hunting down your child when they are fleeing punishment in terror like the villain in the Halloween movies, and even manufacturing occasions to whip in order to "train them", if you don't immediately recoil from such things, I would highly recommend you put down the plastic tubing and go pick up your Bible. You may have reason to be concerned about the state of your soul.</blockquote>
<p>Laurie <a href="http://lauriemo.blogspot.com/2010/02/in-which-i-speak-of-unspeakable.html">speaks out</a>:</p>
<blockquote>And, PLEASE, won't the men in the church stand up and speak?! This is NOT just a mommy problem. The fathers are at the head of these Pearl households. The wives are taught to submit to them. Nothing will change unless we reach the men, and these are NOT men who will learn from women.</blockquote>
<p>Paul, via <a href="https://www.salon.com/2010/02/23/no_greater_joy/">Salon</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Not to be crass, but you slap the title 'Christian' on something, and all of a sudden it's <em>the</em> 'Christian' thing. Sometimes, in my experience, that's all it takes for Christians to start following something. There's not a whole lot of discernment.</blockquote>
<p>We must make a stand against child abuse, child murder, and Pelagianism, and leave no room for doubt. The gospel is not about behavior modification, but regeneration. Our righteousness is not our own, but the righteousness of Christ, which is reckoned unto us by faith alone (<a href="http://www.gnpcb.org/esv/search/?q=php+3:9">Philippians 3:9</a>). Scripture admonishes us over and over again to stand up for the fatherless, the widows, foreigners, and those who are too weak to defend themselves. Please join me in standing up for Lydia and Zariah. Their parents were not salt and light, but were the very wolves in sheep’s clothing against whom we must guard the flock.</p>
