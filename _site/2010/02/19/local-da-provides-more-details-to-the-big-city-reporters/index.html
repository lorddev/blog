<h1>Local DA provides more details to the big city reporters</h1>

<p class="view">by Aaron Lord</p>

<p>Butte County District Attorney Michael Ramsey revealed more details than have previously been described in the media in the Sacramento CBS affiliate’s newscast tonight, in a story that comes complete with props and dramatic reading.</p>

<p>We now learn:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Elizabeth allegedly held the girls down for "several hours" while Kevin beat them, hence the two being tried together for the same crimes.</li>
 	<li>For Zariah, "being a liar and a bad influence on the seven-year-old" was what set them off (we already knew about the alleged mispronunciation trigger).</li>
 	<li>According to the story, the Schatzes admitted to police that they were followers of Michael and Debi Pearl.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also just heard in the local news promo here in Chico 20 seconds ago that Zariah has been released from the hospital. Thank the Lord.</p>
