      <article role="main" class="blog-post">
        <div class="ennote">I've come across an <a href="http://www.equip.org/PDF/DF230.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article from  CRI</a> about the authoritarianism and isolationism of the Pearls and  the entire movement of which they are just one arm.  Author Rachel D.  Ramer traces it back to the theonomy of R.J. Rushdoony:<br /><div><blockquote>Considered the father of Christian  Reconstructionism, Rushdoony has stated, “All the basic governmental  powers in society, save one, the death penalty, have been given [by God]  to the family, not to the state nor to the church....A mark of  anti-Christianity is the move to strip the family of these powers.” In  response to this idea, voices such as <i>Patriarch</i> magazine promote  “home education, home business, home church, home birth, family  ministry, family health, family worship...courtship and betrothal,  family-based welfare.” This view of the family may also include  rejection of organized sports, church youth and singles’ groups, and  neighborhood playmates.<br /></blockquote></div>(If you didn't know, theonomy is bad.  We're talking like  taking sinners out and stoning them in the streets like the Pharisees  did.  Bad.  How come so many people who claim to be Christians skip the  New Testament entirely?  "He who is without sin cast the first stone!")<br /><br />Ramer continues:<br /><div><blockquote><i>Patriarch</i> further suggests that  youth groups and Sunday school programs demonstrate a “failure of the  church to teach the principles of parental responsibility for child  training and to reinforce it in the church’s programs,” and that the use  of these programs in a church “may well be a reason to leave.”<br /></blockquote></div>I have a problem with  youth groups that coincide with normal Lord's Day worship services, because they  create a "church within a church", and the young people don't receive  the benefits of being influenced by older Christian brothers and  sisters.  They grow up and form "college/young adult" churches with the  same kind of music they're used to, and church for them becomes an  affinity club rather than the diverse, cross-cultural,  multi-generational legacy with historical roots that it's supposed to  be.  But I do not at all think that the presence of a youth group or  Sunday school justify leaving a church.<br /><br />In  the Reformed understanding of ecclesiology, the two functions of the  local church are the preaching of the Word and the officiating of the  Sacraments.  For the Reformed, the only valid means for leaving a church  are over 1) improper handling of the Word, and 2) improper handling of  the Sacraments.  Al Mohler <a href="http://www.ligonier.org/learn/articles/should-i-stay-or-should-i-go/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">writes</a>,<br />               <div><blockquote>         Church shopping violates the integrity of the church and the meaning   of church membership. When members leave for insufficient reason, the  fellowship of the church is broken, its witness is weakened, and the  peace and unity of the congregation are sacrificed. Tragically, a  superficial understanding of church membership undermines our witness to  the gospel of Christ.<br /><br />There is no  excuse for this phenomenon. We have no right to leave a  church over preferences about music, personal taste, or even programming  that does not meet expectations.  These controversies or concerns  should prompt the faithful Christian to consider how he might be of  assistance in finding and forging a better way, rather than working to  find an excuse to leave.<br /><br />Christians  cannot look to this question as merely a matter of  consumerism. We are called to love the church and to pray for its peace  and unity, not to look for an opportunity to move to  another congregation.<br /><br />There are times,  however, when it is right to separate from a  congregation or denomination. But in such a case, the issue is not taste  but theology.</blockquote></div>   We have the Reformed confessions as our standards,  whether they be the Belgic Confession, the Heidelberg Catechism, the  Westmister Confession and Catechisms, or the 1689 London Baptist  Confession, as excellent summaries of the system of doctrine taught in  God's Word.  If what you're teaching about a given text differs  substantially from what's taught in those documents, then you might want  to reconsider your interpretation, because people have been thinking  about these things for a couple thousand years now.<br /><br />Ramer quotes my hero, Michael Horton, with his view of the  doctrine of the "two kingdoms":<br /><div><blockquote>Fourth,  <i>Christ and culture in paradox</i> sees the kingdom of God and the  kingdom of humankind as “different spheres with different  purposes....Culture can never be an avenue of finding God....But neither  can culture be an object of disgust, since culture never promises to  save or redeem.” In this view, while not all pleasurable aspects of life  are spiritual in the salvific or godly sense, God is still present in  them.<br /></blockquote></div>Horton  says <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100304174349/http://www.matthiasmedia.com.au:80/briefing/longing/5402/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">elsewhere</a>:<br /><div><blockquote>This  view says that every Christian is a citizen of two cities—the City  of God and the City of Man. Each of these spheres is separate, and they  have different purposes. Luther expressed this idea in his doctrine of  the ‘two kingdoms’. On this model, one cannot coerce faith, nor can one  accommodate faith to secular modes of thought. However, it's possible to  live out one's faith in the light of special revelation so that the  wider culture can experience the influence of Christianity. Calvin and  Augustine also expressed similar ideas.</blockquote></div>This is reflected in the Westminster Confessions' admission  of the distinct spheres of the civil magistrate and the church  government, and it coincides with Romans 13, which says that the civil  magistrate is not your enemy, but your guardian—unless, of course,  you're behaving wickedly, in which case he becomes the rod of God (used  figuratively, as I believe it is usually is in Scripture, except Exodus  21:20, of course) to chasten you.<br /><br />So all those  "Christians" who tell you not to watch good movies, or to  listen to good  music, and instead they advocate watching Kirk Cameron  movies and  listening to K-Love...  Yeah, that stuff sucks.  And the  "Christian"  rock stars are up to just as much no-good backstage as the  "worldly"  counterparts who they're trying to sound like.  Luther said  to the  Christian shoemaker, make a good shoe and sell it at a fair  price.  He  didn't say, put a cross on it, charge 10% more, and market  it as a  Christian shoe, if you can't make it in the "secular"  marketplace.  <i>Gah!</i><br /><br />(In summary: if you're going to listen  to rock, listen to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WZB944?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=lbmusic&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000WZB944">good  stuff</a><img class=" ojroqhqczymfqlqgnudh ojroqhqczymfqlqgnudh  ojroqhqczymfqlqgnudh ojroqhqczymfqlqgnudh ojroqhqczymfqlqgnudh ojroqhqczymfqlqgnudh ojroqhqczymfqlqgnudh ojroqhqczymfqlqgnudh ojroqhqczymfqlqgnudh ojroqhqczymfqlqgnudh ojroqhqczymfqlqgnudh ojroqhqczymfqlqgnudh ojroqhqczymfqlqgnudh ojroqhqczymfqlqgnudh ojroqhqczymfqlqgnudh ojroqhqczymfqlqgnudh ojroqhqczymfqlqgnudh" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=lbmusic&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000WZB944" alt="" border="0" height="1" width="1" />.)<br /><br />We've  already seen examples of the dispensationalist fear-mongering by the  Pearls, telling people if they don't beat their children, they're going  to line up to get the Mark of the Beast tattooed on.  Or they're going  to be lulled into a drug-induced slumber by the New World Order.<br /><div><blockquote>The Pearls also tell  parents, “Fail to use the rod on [a disobedient, bullying child] and you  are creating a ‘Nazi.’” Fear of producing a Nazi may compel parents to  use a “rod” even when their intuition tells them there is a better  option in a particular situation.<br /></blockquote></div>Did anybody else read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wave_%28novel%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>The  Wave</i></a> in high school?<br /><br />This  whole regimented thing is much more like the Hitler Youth than anything  else.  Conformity.  Do what you're told or you'll get a beating.  No  questions, etc.  But wait, there's more:<br /><div><blockquote>“You  must look for opportunities to demonstrate that you have the last word,  that your authority is to be obeyed without question....If, during the  course of a day, no contest arises naturally, you should arrange one.  Seek opportunity to thwart the child’s will, to cause him to submit to  your command.”<br /></blockquote></div>Are  you seriously going to pick a fight with your little kid?  Come on  people, use some discernment!  Throw those crappy books away!<br /><br />"Fathers, do not exasperate your children, so that they will not lose  heart" (Col. 3:21, ESV).<br /><br />You know  how every single time a pastor comes to a text about God as Father, he  has to apologize because he knows that most people probably don't have  good fathers.  And it's because of people like Rushdoony and Pearl, and  all those who advocate their teachings.  If it weren't for those who  twist scripture in order to justify their own abuse, we wouldn't have to  have caveats when we teach on the Fatherhood of God.<br /><br />HT: <a href="http://parentingfreedom.com/2010/02/15/murder-by-discipline-children-investigators-were-led-to-no-greater-joy-ministries-michael-and-debi-pearl-that-espouses-spanking-as-a-necessary-part-of-training-ones-child/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Parenting Freedom</a><a href="http://parentingfreedom.com/2010/02/15/murder-by-discipline-children-investigators-were-led-to-no-greater-joy-ministries-michael-and-debi-pearl-that-espouses-spanking-as-a-necessary-part-of-training-ones-child/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><br /></a></div>
