<h1>Evernote GTD notes</h1>

<p class="view">by Aaron Lord</p>

<p>I’ve been using Evernote for several years. A few months ago I started using an app called Zendone for my GTD workflow. This required a bit of an adjustment, because it has categories within the app which don’t actually correspond to Evernote tags or notebooks, and it uses the <em>titles</em> of your Evernote notes to create task items, rather than checklist items from your notes, which makes going back and forth between Evernote and the app a bit problematic. So, mostly it’s like its own app which happens to use Evernote as its back-end database. To top it off, they just started charging fees, and I don’t really think it’s a service worth paying for.</p>

<p>So I’m going to go back to using Evernote directly. I might utilize <a href="http://www.thesecretweapon.org/the-secret-weapon-manifesto/manifesto-part-1-the-issue">The Secret Weapon</a> for some guidelines, but I’ll also rely on some techniques that I’ve developed over the years and adapted from other apps. Maybe I’ll standardize this workflow and publish it as an alternative to TSW, and perhaps even make an app of my own someday…</p>
