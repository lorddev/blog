<p>After all the <a href="https://www.404media.co/wordpress-checkbox-login-wp-engine/">shenanigans over at WordPress</a>, I've decided to start publishing on Medium. <a href="https://medium.devlord.io/subscribe">You can follow me there if you like</a>. I have 15 subscribers here, so I'll probably be importing you over there after the waiting period is over. I don't know yet all the ins-and-outs of how Medium works so hopefully it doesn't require you to pay to read my stuff! (Update: I think it only does this if the author chooses to monetize, which I won't. If you discover otherwise, email me please. I can send gift links.)</p>

<p>I was a Calvinist before I became an atheist. I was <em>very</em> Calvinist, in fact. It got to the point where I had eventually achieved such a robust Reformation theology that I accepted the idea that God could actually choose to send me to hell for eternity. I figured if it were to happen, it would be because God had determined in his divine will that it would bring him the most glory, and I was cool with that. But that was also kind of a wake-up call.</p>

That is, science and reason tell me that Yahweh, even if he existed, was a murderous tyrant, and so if Christians teach that Jesus was the son of Yahweh, or that Jesus believed he was doing the will of Yahweh,  or that Yahweh raised Jesus from the dead, that these claims must be false.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Baptists had insisted that the way Jesus made disciples was by teaching and persuasion, not by coercion. They held that the government has no competence in religion, and when it seeks to enforce faith it creates wars of religion and hypocrites who claim a faith they do not actually hold... Following a thicker Jesus rules out coercion and thus contributes to religious liberty. The sovereignty of God through all of life requires Christian responsibility in every area and thus bestows democracy to society.</p>

      <!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In my youth I exhibited an acumen for music and was told by my parents that I was to do it all "to the glory of God" (1 Cor. 10:31). Though I studied classical music I was sort of sending energy to the Most High while I played it. My favorite composer was Bach, who was actually a church musician, and most of his works were actually meant to be performed as part of a Lutheran worship service.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2023/10/29/the-odyssey-of-theodicy/">The Odyssey of Theodicy</a></h2>
      <!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Theodicy is the attempt to vindicate God when we see so much evil in the world. During the first phase of my deconstruction, my own theodocious issues weren't quite the same as others. For me, the problem of evil was addressed with by Calvinism and the doctrine of Original Sin. I think the big issue for me was the fact that so many <em>Christians</em> are led astray. If Jesus came to purify the people of God, to weed out the corruption in the institutional religion, how could it be that the Christian church of 2,000 years later would be so far off the mark? It's not the same theodicy of how could God let the Holocaust happen, and it's not quite the theodicy of how could God pre-ordain people to hell (the Reprobation problem), though it's similar. Basically, it's like Jesus' parable of the wheat and the tares, except there isn't any wheat in the tare field. Corruption in the House of God should not exist. For the Glory of his name he would never allow it.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2013/07/01/rethinking-my-gtd-strategy/">Rethinking my GTD strategy</a></h2>
      <p>I've been using Evernote since 2006. The combination of checkboxes and their searchability with the "todo:" search operator allowed me to manage my GTD workflow in a particular manner. Other third-party solutions, such as Zendone, utilized notes as to-do items, ignoring built-in checkboxes altogether. But then when Evernote released a new "Reminders" feature, they piggybacked on it by making the reminders behave as to-do lists, with their own checkboxes, completely separate from the ones in notes. This was a little problematic, as it creates serious fragmentation in your workflow. Perhaps it can be used for "focus" items. I didn't like the old checklists, but I used them. I like the new checklists, but the fact that they can't be correlated with the existing ones makes a transition difficult, and though reminders are supported in the API, they are not supported in the free-text search syntax or saved searches, both of which I use in my regular workflow. (Another area of fragmentation is that Reminders aren't available in the Windows version.)</p>
<p>Enter Springpad. The only way you can enter a checklist is as a separate note type (just like in Google Keep). I don't have a workflow planned up yet, but I'm starting to get some ideas. I also like the "comments" feature, and though this is used in so many modern platforms (blogs, Facebook, G+, etc.), because of my background, I relate it to software development PM apps like Bugzilla or OnTime. Evernote has collaborative features, but it does not have this ability to identify who wrote what when.</p>

      <p>I’ve been using Evernote for several years. A few months ago I started using an app called Zendone for my GTD workflow. This required a bit of an adjustment, because it has categories within the app which don’t actually correspond to Evernote tags or notebooks, and it uses the <em>titles</em> of your Evernote notes to create task items, rather than checklist items from your notes, which makes going back and forth between Evernote and the app a bit problematic. So, mostly it’s like its own app which happens to use Evernote as its back-end database. To top it off, they just started charging fees, and I don’t really think it’s a service worth paying for.</p>

      <p>“The man who prays is the one who thinks that god has arranged matters all wrong, but who also thinks that he can instruct god how to put them right. Half-buried in the contradiction is the distressing idea that nobody is in charge, or nobody with any moral authority. The call to prayer is self-cancelling.” —Christopher Hitchens<br /><br />"There are two governments: the one religious, by which the conscience is trained to piety and divine worship; the other civil, by which the individual is instructed in those duties which, as men and citizens, we are bound to perform. To these two forms are commonly given the not inappropriate names of spiritual and temporal jurisdiction, intimating that the former species has reference to the life of the soul, while the latter relates to matters of the present life, not only to food and clothing, but to the enacting of laws which require a man to live among his fellows purely honorably, and modestly. The former has its seat within the soul, the latter only regulates the external conduct. We may call the one the religious, the other the civil kingdom. Now, these two, as we have divided them, are always to be viewed apart from each other. Let us now return to human laws. If they are imposed for the purpose of forming a religious obligation, as if the observance of them was in itself necessary, we say that the restraint thus laid on the conscience is unlawful. Our consciences have not to do with men but with God only." —John Calvin<br /><br />“I think that if the data is overwhelming in favor, in favor of evolution, to deny that reality will make us a cult, some odd group that’s not really interacting with the real world.” —Dr. Bruce Waltke<br /><br />“Properly read, the bible is the most potent force for atheism ever conceived.” —Isaac Asimov</p>

So I've gone ahead and found a copy of Bethlehem's <a href="http://www.hopeingod.org/news-events/bethlehem-blogs/bethlehem-updates-blog/timeline-transition-pastor-preaching-vision">transition timeline</a> so I could place a <a href="http://www.hopeingod.org/news-events/bethlehem-blogs/bethlehem-updates-blog/timeline-transition-pastor-preaching-vision">link here</a> where it would be easier for people to find it.</p>

      <p>It has been said, “Religion is doing what you are told, regardless of what is right, whereas morality is doing what is right regardless of what you are told.” As an acquaintance of the Schatz family this truth is hugely important to me. Christopher Hitchens produced the following for Vanity Fair:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Do not condemn people on the basis of their ethnicity or color.</li>
	<li>Do not ever use people as private property.</li>
	<li>Despise those who use violence or the threat of it in sexual relations.</li>
	<li>Hide your face and weep if you dare to harm a child.</li>
	<li>Do not condemn people for their inborn nature.</li>
	<li>Be aware that you too are an animal and dependent on the web of nature, and think and act accordingly.</li>
	<li>Do not imagine that you can escape judgment if you rob people with a false prospectus rather than with a knife.</li>
	<li>Turn off that fucking cell phone—you have no idea how unimportant your call is to us.</li>
	<li>Denounce all jihadists and crusaders for what they are: psychopathic criminals with ugly delusions.</li>
	<li>Be willing to renounce any god or any religion if any holy commandments should contradict any of the above. In short: Do not swallow your moral code in tablet form.</li>

<blockquote>If roads were collapsing all across the United States, killing dozens of drivers, we would surely see that as a moment to talk about what we could do to keep roads from collapsing. If terrorists were detonating bombs in port after port, you can be sure Congress would be working to upgrade the nation’s security measures. If a plague was ripping through communities, public-health officials would be working feverishly to contain it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Only with gun violence do we respond to repeated tragedies by saying that mourning is acceptable but discussing how to prevent more tragedies is not. But that’s unacceptable. As others have observed, talking about how to stop mass shootings in the aftermath of a string of mass shootings isn’t “too soon.” It’s much too late.</blockquote>

      <p>When you set up a new instance in the cloud <a href="http://mustfollow.wordpress.com/2012/07/09/visual-studio-in-the-cloudcod/">on Amazon’s EC2 service</a>, if you use the standard snapshots for Windows 2008 R2 hosting with SQL Server, you will find that your C: drive is much smaller than you expected it to be. Basically, you’re maxed out at capacity as soon as you upgrade Visual Studio. A few times a day you’ll receive notifications in the system tray about how the drive is running out of disk space. My first attempt to solve this problem involved attaching an EBS volume as a D: drive, and using that for all of my downloads and SVN working copies. But even when I tried to uninstall some of the default applications (e.g. the C++ 2008 runtime, which I have no use for), I found that it didn’t keep the drive from filling up. So I decided it was time to take a snapshot of the current state of my machine and see what I could do to grow that volume.</p>

      <p>I’m currently in the middle of a project where jQuery is trying to access or manipulate ASP.NET server-side controls. When these controls are nested within, say, a content object, ASP.NET prefixes the ID you give it with the ID of its container. So if you know the id of the container, then you can do this:  <code>$('#mycontent_txtInput').val();</code>. The problem is, when you update your project to the next version of .NET, typically this results in the naming schema changing, e.g. something using dollar signs, etc.</p>

      <p>I have so much appreciation for stakeholders who appreciate what I give to them. You’d think this would be a more common occurrence: people who pay others for awesome things they want, people who make awesome things that their clients want them to make, and people who like the awesome things their consultants make for them. Seems kind of obvious that this would be like the foundation for the global economy or something. But instead it seems like there are a lot of people out there who are settled on mediocrity. So when I find a client who’s enthusiastic about quality, I’m going to bend over backwards for that client. That kind of positive feedback is super valuable to me. In terms of its impact on my mood it’s probably more important a factor in choosing projects than how much they pay. I recently told a certain client they were my favorite. They’re actually the lowest paying on my current roster.</p>

But I think it became increasingly clear that my bad situation was having a bad effect on my heart, and on my psyche, and it was hurting my family. The job was literally killing me.</p>

      <p>So, I have a couple of pending offers for side gigs lingering out there, and theoretically on any given weekend evening, someone could IM me and ask me to do a few small things for them. The problem is, I don’t have a suitable Windows dev environment at home. I’ve had such great machines at the companies I’ve worked at for the last several years that I’ve been able to let my PC collect dust and just use my MacBook, iPad, and iPhone for whatever I needed a computer for at home. So, I thought I had better get something ready, and after a little bit of research, it became obvious that a cloud machine was going to be more economical than running up debt on a Best Buy card for a brand new Thinkpad. I found a few helpful resources online, including these <a href="http://blog.michaelckennedy.net/2011/06/13/building-a-cloud-os-for-net-developers-part-2/">two</a> <a href="http://www.michaelckennedy.net/blog/2010/01/31/BuildingWindowsMachinesInAmazonEC2.aspx">posts</a> from Michael Kennedy.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2012/07/07/abbreviations-considered-harmful/">Abbreviations Considered Harmful</a></h2>
      <p>I recently struggled for several hours over a sorted ASP.NET GridView control which was failing to behave properly. I found that on PostBack for the LinkButtons, the SortCommand was returning expressions such as &#8220;LocationDesc&#8221; and &#8220;PositionDesc&#8221;. I was confused as to why the sort direction was attached to the expression when it was already part of the SortDirection property of the EventArgs object, and assumed it might have had something to do with the way the other developers were persisting the sort data in ViewState. So I wrote a function to strip out the &#8220;Desc&#8221; from the sort expression, but as I got further in my testing, the database was telling me that &#8220;Location&#8221; and &#8220;Position&#8221; weren&#8217;t in the table. I checked to see if it was a matter of them not being included in the select statement vs. not being in the actual database table. When I looked at the database table, lo and behold, the fields were called &#8220;LocationDesc&#8221; and &#8220;PositionDesc&#8221;. Apparently &#8220;desc&#8221; is short for &#8220;description&#8221; (which is itself redundant). This results in such obviously horrid SQL statements as <code>select * from [mytable] order by locationdesc desc</code>. Terrible.</p>
<p>So I made a request to the rest of my team: let&#8217;s not do this anymore, okay? But they shot me down, as they always do. &#8220;We&#8217;ve always done it that way,&#8221; or, &#8220;That&#8217;s the naming convention they used in the legacy tables.&#8221;</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter if it sucked in the old days. That&#8217;s no reason to keep sucking! The fact that we&#8217;re still fixing things implies that what was done in the old days was not good enough. Let&#8217;s try not to suck anymore, okay?</p>

      <p>I work in office that has remote locations on the other side of the country, so people literally have to phone it in sometimes. Even some of the local employees only come to the office three or four days a week and so they’re also phoning it in sometimes. But sometimes there’re people who are present who are still phoning it in. Be it people who have three monitors at their workstation rather than the standard two, so that they can watch their favorite movies on one screen all day long while they code on the other two. Or people who write code that looks like they don’t care if no one else can read it. Accessing data columns or traversing the control tree by index, for example, instead of using column names or IDs. Or using multiple nested html tables for page layout when that’s not what they’re for. Seriously, <em>that’s so last century!</em> Or doing the old copy-and-paste routine, literally within 10 lines of the previous usage of a block of code, and not bothering to take the 3.57 seconds it would take to move it into a reusable function so you can save 3.67 seconds of latency for every single page request that pulls down that client-side code.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2012/04/01/sunday-night-theology-law-and-gospel-in-colquhoun-and-wright/">Sunday Night Theology: Law and Gospel in Colquhoun and Wright</a></h2>
      <p>Lee Irons <a href="http://upper-register.typepad.com/blog/2012/03/colquhouns-a-treatise-on-the-law-and-the-gospel.html">posted some wonderful excerpts</a> from 19th-century Scottish minister John Colquhoun's &quot;A Treatise on the Law and the Gospel.&quot;</p>
<p>His first quote from pp. 55-56 presents an excellent summary of covenant theology: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The violated covenant of works [in Adam]… was not, and could not be, made or renewed with the Israelites at Sinai; for it was a broken covenant, and besides, it was a covenant between God and man as friends, whereas now man has become the enemy of God. But though it was not renewed with them, yet it was, on that solemn occasion, repeated and displayed to them. It was not proposed to them in order that they might consent, by their own works, to fulfill the condition of it; but it was displayed before them in subservience to the covenant of grace that they might see how impossible it was for them as condemned sinners to perform that perfect obedience which is the immutable condition of life in it… that by means of it, finding themselves utterly destitute of perfect righteousness, they might be impelled to take hold of the covenant of grace in which the perfect righteousness of the second Adam is provided and exhibited for the justification of all who believe. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have more reading to do on this matter, but this almost sounds compatible with N.T. Wright's interpretations of <a href="http://www.ntwrightpage.com/Wright_New_Perspectives.htm">Pauline justification</a>. (Although I don't mean to imply that's what Irons is necessarily getting at, as he's an elder in the PCA, and those guys <em>really</em> <a href="http://adrianwarnock.com/2007/04/the-pca-considering-excluding-followers-of-n-t-wright/">don't like Wright</a>.)</p>
<p>Since Luther, Protestants have often read Paul's argument against justification by works in the context of Johann Tetzel's Catholic indulgences. Wright says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The only notice that most mainstream theology has taken of this context is to assume that the Jews were guilty of the kind of works-righteousness of which theologians from Augustine to Calvin and beyond have criticised their opponents…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like modern-day evangicals, they read their current situations into the text instead of trying to understand the original context in which it was written.</p>
<p>Basically, Wright's hypothesis is that the Jews <em>would have</em> understood Colquhoun's conclusions about the Abrahamic covenant of grace vs. the Mosaic republication of the covenant of works at Sinai, and that they would have relied on God to &quot;provide the Lamb&quot; just as Abraham did (Genesis 22:8).</p>
<p>There were laws in the Torah which were not directly related to the moral law summarized in the Ten Commandments, but which served to separate the Hebrews from the pagan cultures around them and distinguish them as the &quot;peculiar people&quot; of God. In Wright's reading, the ceremonial laws were obeyed as signs of the covenant community, as a source of ethnic pride. But in the New Covenant, the &quot;boundaries&quot; of the people of God are expanded as the Big Tent is spread out to include the Gentiles, and the &quot;justification&quot; of these boundaries is now faith, not works. In Wright, Paul's condemnation of the Judiazers is not that they sought <em>salvation</em> by works, but that they &quot;established their own righteousness&quot; by keeping circumcision and dietary restrictions (marks of the Old Covenant) to keep themselves segregated from the Gentile Christians and maintain a sense of Jewish exceptionalism, which bothered Paul because it represented the same hateful zealotry he used to carry prior to conversion.</p>
<p>Mark Mattison writes in his <a href="http://www.thepaulpage.com/a-summary-of-the-new-perspective-on-paul/">summary</a> of Wright's perspective:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wright explodes the myth that the pre-Christian Saul was a pious, proto-Pelagian moralist seeking to earn his individual passage into heaven. Wright capitalizes on Paul’s autobiographical confessions to paint rather a picture of a zealous Jewish nationalist whose driving concern was to cleanse Israel of Gentiles as well as Jews who had lax attitudes toward the Torah. Running the risk of anachronism, Wright points to a contemporary version of the pre-Christian Saul: Yigal Amir, the zealous Torah-loyal Jew who assassinated Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin for exchanging Israel’s land for peace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The whole idea of covenant theology is that the plan of salvation has been the same since the beginning, that the faith of the Christian <em>is</em> the faith of Abraham. The question I think Colquhoun is asking about Old Testament Jews and Wright is asking about the Judaizers is whether they might have <em>understood</em> the place of Law and Gospel all along, as opposed to what many modern Christians might assume, that the Gospel was somehow veiled for a thousand years between Moses and Christ while everyone was left to pull themselves up by their own bootstraps.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2012/03/22/authority-vs-authorship/">Authority vs. Authorship</a></h2>
      <p>As part of the current discussion on the origins of the Fundamentalism/Modernism controversy, I present the following paragraph from Charles Augustus Briggs’s address at Union Theological Seminary in 1891, <em>The Authority of Holy Scripture</em>.</p>
<blockquote>The third barrier is the authenticity of the Scriptures. The only authenticity we are concerned about in seeking for the divine authority of the Scriptures is <em>divine authenticity</em>, and yet many theologians have insisted that we must prove that the Scriptures were written by or under the superintendence of prophets and apostles. Refusing to build on the authority of the living Church, they have sought an authority in the dead Church; abandoning the authority of institutional Christianity, they have sought a prop in floating traditions. These traditions assign authors to all the books of the Bible, and on the authority of these human authors, it is claimed that the Bible is divine. These theologians seem altogether unconscious of the circle of reasoning they are making. They prove the authority of the Bible from the authority of its authors. But what do we know of the authors apart from the Bible itself? Apart from the sacred writings,— Moses and David, Paul and Peter, would be no more to us than Confucius or Sakya Muni. They were leaders of men, but how do we know that they were called of God to speak divine words to us? The only way in which we can prove their authority is from their writings, and yet we are asked to accept the authority of the writings on the authority of these authors. When such fallacies are thrust in the faces of men seeking divine authority in the Bible, is it strange that so many turn away in disgust? It is just here that the Higher Criticism has proved such a terror in our times. Traditionalists are crying out that it is destroying the Bible, because it is exposing their fallacies and follies. It may be regarded as the certain result of the science of the Higher Criticism that Moses did not write the Pentateuch or Job; Ezra did not write the Chronicles, Ezra, or Nehemiah; Jeremiah did not write the Kings or Lamentations; David did not write the Psalter, but only a few of the Psalms; Solomon did not write the Song of Songs or Ecclesiastes, and only a portion of the Proverbs; Isaiah did not write half of the book that bears his name. The great mass of the Old Testament was written by authors whose names or connection with their writings are lost in oblivion. If this is destroying the Bible, the Bible is destroyed already. But who tells us that these traditional names were the authors of the Bible? The Bible itself? The creeds of the Church? Any reliable historical testimony? None of these! Pure, conjectural tradition! Nothing more! We are not prepared to build our faith for time and eternity upon such uncertainties as these. We desire to know whether the Bible came from God, and it is not of any great importance that we should know the names of those worthies chosen by God to mediate His' revelation. It is possible that there is a providential purpose in the withholding of these names, in order that men might have no excuse for building on human authority, and so should be forced to resort to divine authority. It will ere long become clear to the Christian people that the Higher Criticism has rendered an inestimable service to this generation and to the generations to come. What has been destroyed has been the fallacies and conceits of theologians; the obstructions that have barred the way of literary men from the Bible. Higher Criticism has forced its way into the Bible itself and brought us face to face with the holy contents, so that we may see and know whether they are divine or not. Higher Criticism has not contravened any decision of any Christian council, or any creed of any Church, or any statement of Scripture itself. It has rather brought the long-neglected statement of the Westminster Confession into prominence:
<blockquote>The authority of the Holy Scripture, for which it ought to be believed and obeyed, dependeth not upon the testimony of any man or church, but wholly upon God (who is truth itself), the author thereof; and therefore it is to be received, because it is the word of God.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>Christianity is inconsistent with the present social condition of New York, and the other great cities of the world. We have no right to the name of Christians; we bring reproach on the name of Jesus Christ; we dishonor the God of the Bible, and are stumbling-blocks in the way of the suffering multitudes, obstructing their way to God, and their entrance into the kingdom of heaven, if we do not, with all our souls, strive to relieve their misery and want. The Bible, through and through, insists upon the redemption of the bodies of men, as well as their souls, and of the whole framework of human society. This heavenly teaching is so against the prejudices and the attainments of mankind, that it is an unmistakable evidence of the divine authority of the Scriptures that so strongly urge it upon us. (Charles A. Briggs, <em>The Authority of Holy Scripture</em>, 1891. Within a year of this address he was censured and excommunicated by Fundamentalists.)</blockquote>

      <h2><a href="/2012/03/20/calvary-chapel-and-fundamentalism/">Calvary Chapel and Fundamentalism</a></h2>
      <p>The word <em>Fundamentalism</em> was once a proper noun referring to the conservative religious movement that pushed back against old-school Protestant liberalism in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The label has come to be applied much more broadly, even in use now to describe ultra-conservative factions in various religions, not just Christian.</p>
<p>Recently someone described me as an ex-fundamentalist. One doesn't usually see oneself as one's opponent; even when one meets a list full of definitions, there is a sort of revisionist history in one's progressive mind regarding the label itself. (This, despite the fact that I wrote a blog several years ago entitled &quot;I am a Fundamentalist&quot;, which focused on the original Five Fundamentals, and not the conservative movement fundamentalism has become.) I think back to when I was in junior high and high school in Las Vegas, when I strongly opposed my science teachers and picketed alongside fellow churchgoers with &quot;No on 7&quot; signs in 1990. Of course that kid was a fundamentalist. I guess I had attributed that to my own mistaken zeal rather than to the result of what I had been taught in my religious upbringing in Calvary Chapel. Today's post is a short therapeutic exercise to point out ways in which the church I was brought up in was fundamentalist, so I can tie the millstone of blame around the neck of my teachers and pastors.</p>
<p>Before we continue I need to reiterate the above phrase: <em>teachers and pastors.</em> I recognize that the sheep don't necessarily agree with their shepherds on all things, and there is greater diversity in congregations than in their leadership. But because I'm such a good student, I had always aligned myself with my leaders. And the Bible seems to hold spiritual leaders accountable for how they teach and lead.</p>
<p>The Calvary Chapel movement was birthed by holey-jeans-and-flip-flop-wearing hippies on the beaches of southern California. They'd probably think of fundamentalists as those grumpy preachers in the movie <em>Footloose.</em> They would have associated fundamentalism with hair length. They'd describe an old-fashioned guy in a suit like John MacArthur as a Fundamentalist (and I would agree), but they certainly wouldn't think of <em>themselves</em> that way. In their own literature they claim to be in the &quot;middle ground&quot; between fundamentalism and Pentecostalism. But these two things are not different ends of a continuum; they are different categories altogether. Fundamentalism is a reaction to modernism, not to spiritual gifts. As for the Pentacostal category, Calvary Chapel is not cessationist or even halfway there. They are actually quite charasmatic, just in a way that is more palatable to rich white Southern California suburbanites. One can be a fundamentalist charasmatic just as easily as one can be a theologically-liberal cessationist. (If they didn't despise the seminary, they would know this.)</p>
<p>Fundamentalists are opposed to alcohol and supported prohibition a hundred years ago, even though the Bible is replete with the joyful imagery of the fruit of the vine. Calvary Chapels are anti-alcohol, though they would hesitate to admit it. If they saw you walking into a pub they'd condemn you for stumbling the weaker brethren. They would say, &quot;The Bible doesn't say drinking is a sin, but if you look at this, this, and this, it's hard how you can say that you can drink to the glory of God, <em>tsk-tsk.</em>&quot;</p>
<p>Calvary tends to lean inordinately rightward. Adherents watch Fox News religiously. Pastors <a href="http://www.rediscovergodinamerica.com/promote.htm">participate in conferences</a> in which separation of church and state is decried and Christian Fascism is promoted. They <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/02/14/santorum-lgbt-equality-waters-down-marriage/">invite GOP candidates</a> to <a href="http://election2012coverage.com/2011/09/republican-primary-candidate-newt-gingrich-addresses-calvary-chapel-in-newbury/">speak from their pulpits</a>, though this is a violation of the historical Protestant doctrine of the two kingdoms, as well as federal laws governing tax-exempt organizations.</p>
<p>One of the biggest themes for fundamentalists has always been their opposition to the theory of evolution, though B. B. Warfield, who was one of the authors of <em>The Fundamentals</em> (1915), did not consider evolutionary science to be in conflict with a proper understanding of Scripture. Calvary Chapel certainly fits the anti-evolution bill. Chuck Smith is a staunch opponent, and all students at Calvary's Bible college are required to listen to his sermons through the entire Bible, beginning, of course, with his views on origins. Chuck Smith, Jr., who indicated openness to the theory, was actually <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/print/2006/sep/02/local/me-smiths2">excommunicated</a> from his own father's denomination.</p>
<p>Fundamentalism has its roots in dispensationalism, for which Calvary Chapel is the earth's torchbearer. They require unequivocal conformity to their own eschatological position, which closely resembles Harold Camping's (Chuck Smith used to <a href="http://americanvision.org/4545/before-harold-camping-there-was-chuck-smith/">predict</a> the second coming just as often as Camping, which is ironic because they usually make fun of datesetters now). Because of their escapist apocalyptic views, many don't educate their kids or seek gainful employment or secure housing because they don't expect to be around much longer. I would imagine there are thousands of children all over the country who have been left uneducated and without an inheritance due to Calvary's teachings. This, I think, is the most damaging of their policies. For the poor ordinary folk in their congregations, it means they are left without stability in the event that a pastor passes away, since no plans are made for the future. Many of their buildings are strip malls or movie theaters instead of permanent, lasting structures. But the worst part is the lost futures of all the children, who have had no investment made in their future while their parents sit around and wait for the next comet.</p>
<p>Finally, Calvary Chapel <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dark-Side-Calvinism-Calvinist-System/dp/1931667888">militantly</a> opposes Calvinism in ways that are, frankly, uncivil. George Bryson gets his blood pressure up and refers to Calvinism as &quot;The Dark Side.&quot; I've known many individuals removed from ministry positions after they discovered the Doctrines of Grace, and you can search the web to find it's a nationwide phenomenon. Calvinists are treated as cultists, which is an ironic position coming from Calvary Chapel. Though there are Calvinist breeds of fundamentalism, the hard line Calvary takes against Calvinism is really indicative of their intolerance of diversity of opinion. They've
built a homogenous empire that goes way beyond fundamentalism in its exclusivity. Fundamentalism was actually an <em>ecumenical</em> attempt to combat ivory-tower academics. But Calvary sets itself in opposition to any form of denomination. As the Lord tarries, the empire will crumble and they will find themselves without allies in a world where the rest of the Christian church has passed them by. They'll find that all the bridge-burning wasn't such a good idea after all.</p>

      <p>A few years ago, while evaluating what position I was going to take during a congregational vote regarding the adoption of a certain confession, I started researching various theological interpretations of Genesis 1-3. I came across the <em>framework theory,</em> best formulated by Lee Irons and Meredith Kline. The framework view presents Genesis 1 in two stanzas, identifying the parallelism between the two and the poetic crescendo, and how these identify the passage as <em>apocalyptic</em> genre and not historical prose.</p>

The Bible is no better than hydromancy or witchcraft, if we seek for divine guidance by the chance opening of the Book.

<p>We'll start off with &quot;Shipping Up to Boston&quot; by Boston's own Dropkick Murphys. This tune was a big hit for them, and was used in a couple movie soundtracks. With very few words, it can be thought of as an instrumental and an anthem at the same time.</p>
<p>&quot;If I Should Fall From Grace With God&quot; (The Pogues) - This is the title track from their third album, produced by Steve Lillywhite in 1988. This was their best-selling album, topping off at #3 on the UK charts. It's my favorite, too.</p>
<p>&quot;Ward's Favorite/The Morning Star,&quot; etc. (Celtic Fiddle Festival) - No, it’s not a fiddle camp; it’s not even a compilation: it’s a band! I’ve long been a fan of Kevin Burke… This was recorded live and you can hear the hootin' and hollerin' as the set builds.</p>
<p>&quot;Dillon's Fancy/Maids in the Meadow/Toss the Feathers&quot; (Kevin Crawford) - Crawford is the frontman for Irish group Lúnasa, this was recorded a few years before that group's inception.</p>
<p>&quot;The Rare Ould Times&quot; (Flogging Molly) - Here's a number from Molly Malone's darling house band. A song from the 1970s first recorded by the Dublin City Ramblers. Characteristically, Flogging Molly start this tune like a ballad and turn it into something quite different.</p>
<p>&quot;The Rocky Road to Dublin&quot; (The Tossers) - Chicago's The Tossers provide an energetic angst to this Irish classic. The Tossers are great, as they're technically classified as Celtic punk even though they only use traditional acoustic instrumentation.</p>
<p>&quot;Billy's Bones&quot; (The Pogues) - From their second studio album, this is a Shane MacGowan romper. &quot;And there's mothers cryin' all over this world…for their poor dead darling boys and girls.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Morning Dew&quot; (Peatbog Faeries) - Okay, I admit, Peatbog Faeries are a Scottish band, but this is an Irish song, so there. It's a great reel in E-minor. Martin Hayes also has a great version of it on <em>The Lonesome Touch.</em></p>
<p>&quot;The Irish Rover&quot; (Dropkick Murphys) - Another Irish classic, the Murphys make it a little bit louder. I'm super surprises they didn't record it until their seventh album!</p>
<p>&quot;Swagger&quot; (Flogging Molly) - Their instrumental hit featuring Bridget Regan's fiddle, it's a great selection for a St. Paddy's mix.</p>
<p>&quot;The Parting Glass&quot; (The Pogues) - From their second album, this minor-key cover of a classic Irish ballad has a slightly disturbing twinge to it, almost like a mechanical dirge.</p>
<p>&quot;Heroes From Our Past&quot; (Dropkick Murhpys) - Time for a rocking working-class anthem with plenty of pipes!</p>
<p>&quot;The Chorus Reel/Ashmolean House&quot; (Jerry O'Sullivan) - Some reels on uilleann pipes with Seamus Eagan on banjo.</p>
<p>&quot;The Dear Irish Boy&quot; (Willie Clancy) - An air from one of the most famous uilleann pipers of the 20th century.</p>
<p>&quot;Shane Bradley&quot; (The Pogues) - A beautiful instrumental composed by Shane MacGowan, this tune appears on <em>If I Should Fall from Grace with God.</em></p>
<p>We'll close with a pretty rockin' version &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; by DKM…</p>
<p><em>Sláinte!</em></p>
<p>P.S. Don't drive drunk.</p>

My previous argument about Apple shooting themselves in the foot still stands, historically, as they’ve likely missed out on income opportunities due to the long delay, but I think the service is <em>finally</em> suitable for prime time.</p>

      <p>I was talking with my wife the other night as we lay in bed staring at the dark ceiling and listening to the storm of freezing rain pelt the roof and windows. I thanked her for curing me of my Fundamentalism. I thanked her for being patient with me as I got over complementarianism. She mentioned the symbolism in Genesis, where Eve is taken out of Man’s side, not because she is subservient to him, but because she is his equal. We talked about how I had always thought “help meet” meant a woman’s purpose is to help her husband achieve his purpose. (That’s how my mom lives, after all. I can’t imagine what she’s going to do when my dad gets old and dies.) Then I told her a story about an article I read that talked about how dominionist theocratic fascists were actually trying to legislate stay-at-home motherhood. She thought that was pretty unbelievable. But that’s the direction the party we used to belong to is heading.</p>

      <p>A lot has happened in the last year. I became a member of a mainline church, though we cannot attend very often with our little kids, and my wife’s disability—there simply isn’t enough time in the weekend for me to keep up with chores, and some Sundays my wife is just in so much pain she can’t do anything but lay in bed and pray for relief. I was diagnosed with a hereditary condition indicating a high risk for heart disease; my paternal grandfather died at 50, and yes, this is likely related to that. I started running several days a week as a preventive measure, and have been competing in a lot of local distance races. We bought our dream house and moved up into the foothills.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2012/02/27/marriage-stats-and-prayer/">Marriage stats and prayer</a></h2>
      <p>Over the weekend we went to a friend’s wedding. During the wedding, people kept mentioning divorce statistics. Basically, the saying went like this:</p>
<ol>
	<li>The divorce rate is approximately 50%.</li>
	<li>The divorce rate among Christians is no better, also 50%.</li>
	<li>The conclusion is then made that the people being surveyed were not <em>true</em> Christians, because the divorce rate among couples who pray together every single day is only one in a thousand. All <em>true</em> Christian couples pray together every day.</li>
</ol>
<p>My gut reaction:</p>
<ul>
	<li>This is probably a fallacy.</li>
	<li>Talk about a guilt trip. Who in the world can formally pray every single day of their life, let alone ensure that such prayer occurs with one's spouse? And then are you therefore supposed to live in fear that your marriage will fail when you miss a day?</li>
	<li>I just went through a mental list of a men's prayer group I was in 10 years ago. 80% of us were single at the time, but all have since wed. However, only 40% are still married. That's a very high divorce rate of 60% among a group of apparent born-again Christians who already had a significant predisposition towards an active prayer life.</li>

<p>My children have a tendency to get into things and move things around. As a result, the original insoles for my Saucony Kinvara 2 running shoes have been sitting in plain sight for a few days. It suddenly dawned on me how thin they were compared to the spongy insoles I had replaced them with on the advice of my physical therapist, and I realized my judgment of the shoes was made based on the insoles Saucony didn’t intend them to be worn with. So I switched them back out, and it makes all the difference.</p>

If they say anything they limit it to shallow topics. But there is one side that remains presumptively loud. I think it can be traced to events that started off the year 2011, beginning with the start of the Arab revolutions and the Scott Walker attack on working people in Wisconsin, and growing steadily through the year as the Tea Party congress tried to crash the Federal government into the ground over the debt ceiling and Republican campaign season began.</p>

<p>In <a href="/blog/social-justice-and-the-christian/">my previous post</a>, I discussed how social justice has played a factor in the development of my worldview. I’ve sought to allow the things Jesus was passionate about to affect my own ideologies. In fact, the Scott Walker union-busting fiasco in Wisconsin which was the last straw that caused me to finally change my voter registration. Another major issue for me has been the religious right’s Dispensationalist foreign policy in the Middle East. Since I first began to hear John Piper mention the plight of Christians in Palestine years ago, I began to see how damaging U.S. foreign policy has been towards all non-Jewish states in the region. As amillennial and Reformed, holding to covenant theology as an overarching view of Scripture, I am strongly opposed to such policies.</p>

Big church: you worship God in community, gathered, hundreds of voices together. You don't feel like it's "us vs. world".</blockquote>
<p>Driving around downtown Chico on a Lord’s Day morning, you’ll see lots of people walking all in the same direction, and you know where they’re headed. You see people you recognize outside on the church patio between services catching up over coffee. The rest of the week you may find yourself smiling to random people on the street instead of ignoring them. You start to see yourself as part of a large community of Christ-followers. It’s a far cry from fundamentalist isolationism.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2011/06/10/the-marks-of-an-abusive-church/">The Marks of an Abusive Church</a></h2>
      <p>Before I discuss the marks of a healthy church, which I will do in my next post, I need to go into some background a little bit. I have a lot of baggage when it comes to churches. Through several years of chaos since experiencing a painful church split a decade ago, and then having to leave a few others, I’ve become sort of an unwitting expert in what’s right or wrong about churches, and contrary to what many would think, it doesn’t boil down to musical style or baptismal practices. Though I will relate some personal experience here, my attribution of these qualities as “abusive” is not completely subjective or arbitrary. Ronald M. Enroth, professor of sociology at Westmont College, wrote a book called <i>Churches That Abuse</i> (which is <a href="http://www.ccel.us/churches.toc.html">available for online reading</a>), in which he relays the experiences of many individuals he has interviewed from abusive church backgrounds. As I read each chapter, it was scary how often I found myself identifying with the stories he presents.<br /><br />Some abusive churches sound almost cultic. But you don’t just need right doctrine to avoid abuse; you need a right ecclesiology, and a right polity. Enroth writes, “A central theme of this book is that spiritual abuse can take place in the context of doctrinally sound, Bible preaching, fundamental, conservative Christianity. All that is needed for abuse is a pastor accountable to no one and therefore beyond confrontation.”<br /><br />A lot of the churches I have been involved with have had an overdeveloped eschatology, and a very underdeveloped ecclesiology, with authoritarian structures with no accountability or elders. Either no membership whatsoever, or a heavily policed membership in which speaking to outsiders about church matters was forbidden. I’ve experienced too much emphasis on experience and receiving direct “words from the Lord” on one hand, or too much emphasis on a movement’s senior pastor’s dogmatic interpretation of God’s word on the other. Completely cessationist on one hand, or so seemingly powerful in the spiritual gifts that I’d confess all my sins to someone in leadership because I was convinced they already knew because of their “word of knowledge.” Blaming the devil for everything, or completely lacking any confidence in man’s sinful nature that all things secular were denounced and the world was seen as “out there” rather than something we’re part of. “Faith healing” services where we were made to feel like the only reason we had to wear contacts was because we didn’t have “enough” faith, or feigned differences in leg length allegedly went away as legs grew before our eyes in response to fervent prayer. <br /><br />I’ve been involved in churches where earthquakes and billboards were seen as the voice of God, and others where the clear teaching of Scripture was dismissed just because it didn’t fit with their man-made dogmas. I have been spiritually violated by those I trusted, and suffered psychological manipulation. There was confrontational intimidation when you expressed opinions not in line with their dogmas, or if as a musician, I found myself too stretched, unable to commit to a new “worship” band when I was already in two others, or unable to attend prayer meetings because I needed to focus on school. I was in financial bondage as well, told by well to-do pastors that I had to tithe even off of my unemployment insurance payments. (So much for separation of church and state… The church was funded by the EDD!)<br /><br />Abusive churches tend to take a few verses in particular and elevate them above all the rest, as a sort of trump card. One of them is “Don’t touch the Lord’s anointed.” Yeah, can’t argue with that, can you? The problem is, in context, this statement had nothing to do with the church, but politics, with David talking about deposing the king, practicing great care to guard against his own presumption or the pressure of his followers. The Bible tells us all over the place to guard against abusive shepherds, but it says in Romans 13 that our political leaders are put in place by God.<br /><br />If people are able to leave an abusive church and go somewhere else, often the verse of choice preached to those who remain is, “They went out from us that it would be clear yet were never of us.” This was spoken by the apostle John in another particular context, regarding particular people two thousand years ago. But many abusive churches take this verse and make it their own any time a member decides to leave and become part of the universal church, causing all their friends to shun them as if they are now unbelievers.<br /><br />Another mark of an unhealthy church is isolationism, which I mentioned in my last post as a non-Reformed idea. One of the triggers of our recent migration away from conservatism and fundamentalism was the death of Lydia Schatz. I have written about the Schatz family before. They could definitely be described as isolationist. They used to attend a tiny church I had helped plant. Lydia’s father was a fan of perfectionism, and he even expected it from his little ones. The church was so small, lacked a broad-based educated congregation or seminary-trained leadership or other denominational resources that could have spotted the warning signs, and it makes me sick to my stomach to think that if I had recognized the signs I could have said something to authorities or encouraged some accountable fellowship around him that could have steered him into a less isolationist direction.<br /><br />The Schatzes left that church, and so did we. Our family ended up at another small church that was equally low on resources, and evidently, at least as isolationist. The morning after the event, the news about it had already spread, and here was a perfect teaching opportunity. Perhaps someone could express alternate exegesis of the meaning of “rod” in the Old Testament, or explain how maybe beating your children isn’t necessarily a Christian thing to do. But no. Instead there were prayers from the pulpit that God would deliver this “Christian brother and sister” who were “falsely accused”, being “persecuted by the world for being salt and light”.<br /><br />Pat Zukeran, in an article summarizing <i>Churches That Abuse</i>, wrote, “Abusive churches usually denounce all other Christian churches. They see themselves as spiritually elite. They feel that they alone have the truth and all other churches are corrupt.” According to this definition, until now I have only been to two non-abusive churches in my life. (Interestingly, these two churches are actually partnered together for missions and outreach ministries.)<br /><br />At core of all of these churches’ issues is a lack of continuity with church history, and a lack of accountability with the body of Christ at large. One of the manifestations of this incongruence can be found in the aberrant doctrine of dispensationalism, which directly contradicts what the rest of the Christians in the rest of the world had believed for 1,900 years before its invention. The local Calvary Chapel pastor was interviewed on the local news a few weeks ago, explaining why he thought Harold Camping is a crackpot, but Calvary Chapel’s dispensationalist eschatology doesn’t fare much better.  Camping’s view is tragic because it leads to poor people selling their earthly possessions and ending up destitute. Dispensationalism, on the other hand, breeds environmental exploitation and debt (because “it’s all going to burn” anyway), leads to a war-mongering U.S. foreign policy which causes the deaths of thousands of Christians and Muslims in the Middle East by supporting a racist Israeli government at all costs, and wants to artificially induce the fated “Battle of Armageddon” in order to “hasten the day” of Jesus’ Second Coming. (In stark contrast, the Presbyterian Church encourages divestment in companies that do business in Israel, hoping to pressure them into adopting a more human-rights-oriented stance towards their neighbors.)<br /><br />There’s something to be said for ecumenism, denominational accountability, and church councils.<br /><br />Tomorrow’s post will discuss some characteristics of healthy churches. Yay! (Lord willing it will be a little more upbeat…)&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</p>

<blockquote>“[W]e do not approach God's Word as if we were the first people to read and interpret it. In fact, we draw upon 2,000 years of study, exegesis, reflection, and interpretation that testify to the truths of Scripture.” —Daniel R. Hyde</blockquote>
<p>The doctrine of the perspicuity of Scripture states that what’s ultimately necessary for salvation can be drawn from Scripture with relative ease, but there are some Scriptural truths and doctrines that are more difficult, requiring a great deal of study and learning. So it takes study and learning to be able to discern whether certain things are actually taught in Scripture. The early church found it necessary to form councils and develop creeds to summarize the doctrines of the faith, because so many aberrant teachers were claiming to be ‘biblical’. Similarly, the Reformed churches published their confessions as apologetic documents to set them apart from the Roman church, and to explain to their magistrates and rulers that they were truly orthodox and not some new cult. In modern times, many churches have shorter ‘statements of faith’ that may either summarize the credal doctrines or itemize the particular distinctives of their congregation.</p>

<blockquote>Whenever a Christian encounters a doctrine that has not been taught by anyone in any branch of Christ’s church for over eighteen centuries, one should be very suspect of that teaching. This fact in and of itself does not prove that the new teaching is false. But, it should definitely raise one’s suspicions, for if something is taught in Scripture, it is not unreasonable to expect at least a few theologians and exegetes to have discovered it before. The teaching of a secret pretribulation rapture is a doctrine that never existed before 1830...</blockquote>

The concert was amazing, and it was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, so if they are coming to your area, be sure to see them. They don’t have any recordings that are just this trio; though they have collaborated often, the record they are promoting is ‘concerto-style’, with them accompanied by the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, and though some of the tunes they perform on the tour are on the album, but most aren’t, and some are considerably rearranged or completely new derivations, based on, for example, a theme from the horn section that they didn’t get to play themselves. (In my opinion, there are so many millions of notes being played by these talented performers—only half of which can really be noticed—that I don’t think the orchestra is necessary.)

The region's transformation from fertile woodland to eroded scrub or desert has been elucidated by paleobotanists and archaeologists. Its woodlands were cleared for agriculture, or cut to obtain construction timber, or burned as firewood or for manufacturing plaster. Because of low rainfall and hence low primary productivity (proportional to rainfall), regrowth of vegetation could not keep pace with its destruction, especially in the presence of overgrazing by abundant goats.  With the tree and grass cover removed, erosion proceeded and valleys silted up, while irrigation agriculture in the low-rainfall environment led to salt accumulation. These processes, which began in the Neolithic era, continued into modern times. For instance, the last forests near the ancient Nabataean capital of Petra, in modern Jordan, were felled by the Ottoman Turks during construction of the Hejaz railroad just before World War I.<br /><br />Thus, Fertile Crescent and eastern Mediterranean societies had the misfortune to arise in an ecologically fragile environment. They committed ecological suicide by destroying their own resource base. Power shifted westward as each eastern Mediterranean society in turn undermined itself, beginning with the oldest societies, those in the east (the Fertile Crescent). Northern and western Europe has been spared this fate, not because its inhabitants have been wiser but because they have had the good luck to live in a more robust environment with higher rainfall, in which vegetation regrows quickly. Much of northern and western Europe is still able to support productive intensive agriculture today, 7,000 years after the arrival of food production. In effect, Europe received its crops, livestock, technology, and writing systems from the Fertile Crescent, which then gradually eliminated itself as a major center of power and innovation.

      <p>“Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.” Romans 12:2 (ESV)<br /><br /><a href="http://www.whitehorseinn.org/">White Horse Inn</a>’s Rod Rosenblatt was on the conservative Lutheran talk radio program <a href="http://issuesetc.org/">Issues, Etc.</a> from July 12-16.  On Wednesday’s <a href="http://issuesetc.org/podcast/533071410H2S2.mp3">episode</a>, he talked about old-line Protestant liberalism’s view of Scripture as a product of evolution, the view that “only the uneducated would say what Grandma says, that this is God’s very word. The educated know better, and if it’s use at all, it’s as a springboard to your sort of experience of… not even salvation–that they didn’t believe in either–your experience of deeper education on things important.”&lt;blockquote&gt;When Christians get together and start talking about “worldly”… the things that come up are from the saloon in the early Americas, you know, cigar smoking and whiskey drinking and that sort of thing.  We don’t see that <em>worldly</em> first applies to joining up with the skepticism of a given age. It’s first of all a matter of the mind. And it’s tough to go up against what 90% of your own contemporaries think is what’s in vogue, or a better representation of a position than it was a century ago.  That’s tough.  But we’re up against <em>worldly</em> in the worst sense of the word, that is, a sort of a mental set that’s opposed to Christianity, opposed to the person of Christ, opposed to anything creedal, and that occupies the brains of 90% of the educated of our day.

      <blockquote>Many, no doubt, will turn in impatience from the inquiry—all those, namely, who have settled the question in such a way that they cannot conceive of it being reopened. Such, for example, are the pietists, of whom there are still many. "What," they say, "is the need of argument in defense of the Bible? Is it not the Word of God, and does it not carry with it an immediate certitude of its truth which could only be obscured by defence? If science comes into contradiction with the Bible, so much the worse for science!" —J. Gresham Machen, <em>Christianity and Liberalism</em>, pp 8,9</blockquote>

The scene was accompanied by a droning violin track, the kind of bagpipe-emulating, medieval-viol-esque drone I have been known to bust out on my own fiddle ever since I was started getting into celtic music about 15 years ago. I knew this television soundtrack piece was just of a higher caliber; I suspected it was not the product of the house composer, so I pulled out Shazam and it told me it was the first track from Jon Hopkins’s album <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VFV1D8?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=lord1689-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001VFV1D8">Insides</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=lord1689-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B001VFV1D8" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" />.

      <p>Scott Rosenberg gave <a href="http://www.wordyard.com/2010/05/03/no-more-bouncers-at-the-journalism-club-door/">a timely talk</a> last Friday at Stanford, addressing the issue of whether bloggers are journalists.  He included the following statement about net neutrality, which topic old media definitely does not know how to cover:&lt;blockquote&gt;This morning John Nichols said something that I want to repeat now: he said, “Most of the people who cover politics don’t know anything about net neutrality,” so the coverage is lousy. That’s quite an admission, I think. And it’s an example of a phenomenon that helps explain why so many blogs do such a better job covering niche subjects than the general news media does.<br /><br />The phenomenon is this: There’s an inverse relationship between the amount of knowledge you have on a given topic and your level of satisfaction with the media coverage of that topic.<br /><br />More simply: the better you know a subject the more you think its coverage stinks.<br /><br />So this model is broken. We need to move the knowledge closer to the coverage. And the more inclusive our definition of journalist is, the more of that knowledge we can actually bring into the coverage.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</p>

God's good pleasure sends as herald its own privileges : any request can both disappoint and be disappointed: It follows that deferment of baptism is more profitable, in accordance with each person's character and attitude, and even age: and especially so as regards children. For what need is there, if there really is no need, for even their sponsors to be brought into peril, seeing they may possibly themselves fail of their promises by death, or be deceived by the subsequent development of an evil disposition? It is true our Lord says, <em> Forbid them not to come to me</em>. So let them come, when they are growing up, when they are learning, when they are being taught what they are coming to : let them be made Christians when they have become competent to know Christ. Why should innocent infancy come with haste to the remission of sins? Shall we take less cautious action in this than we take in worldly matters? Shall one who is not trusted with earthly property be entrusted with heavenly? Let them first learn how to ask for salvation, so that you may be seen to have given to one that asketh. —Tertullian, <span style="font-style:italic;">De Baptismo</span></blockquote>

      <p>I am presenting a couple links here that may be useful for those who are seeking to bring the Reformation into an existing church. As I dig further into the historic Reformed confessions, I find myself agreeing with them more and more. But I am still convinced of two positions that seem to differ with the Reformed church, namely their position on <span style="font-style:italic;">a capella</span> psalter-only singing, and their position on infant baptism. So my first link is to bring to attention the fact that the <em>Trinity Hymnal—Baptist Edition</em> is <a href="http://www.sermonaudio.com/source_prodinfo.asp?PID=gi11105191648">now being sold</a> online at SermonAudio.com. This is great news for those who only need them in small quantities as the snail mail order form previously required didn’t state the shipping cost. Second, there’s a <a href="http://radongas.blogspot.com/2009/11/baptism-and-communion-circumcision-and_29.html">great article</a> on radon.thoughts that brings up a great point that I’ve also been thinking about regarding infant baptism: why do you baptize infants but you won’t let them participate in the Lord’s Supper? Last but not least, <span class="removed_link" title="http://home.worldchat.com/%7Ehordyk/CatechismPreaching.html#">here</span> is an excellent article recommending the practice of preaching through the catechisms at a “second service” each Lord’s day evening.</p>

<p>I’ve already had to deal with the issue of <em>a capella</em> worship as a violin major at Pepperdine University. At the time, I wrote off the practices of the Church of Christ as a result of their heterodox interpretation of the canon, in which the Old Testament is given about as much weight as Greek mythology. But their tradition is much different from the Reformed tradition: though they require <em>a capella</em> singing, they still use four-part harmony congruent with the music theory developed by the devout Lutheran worship leader J. S. Bach, and sing classic hymns on Lord’s day mornings as well as the new praise choruses of the Jesus movement during mid-week college ministry gatherings. What’s worse, they let their worship preference carry over to secular life, giving vocalists and choirs an elevated status over instrumental musicians and orchestras. What else is disturbing is they had their own <em>a capella</em> rock stars, who actually imitated the sounds of instruments and percussion with their mouths. But this is a digression from the matter at hand.</p>

This is disappointing because the Pearls should definitely be held accountable. It's not just a matter of free speech, because of the authority they hold as ministers: ignorant people obey them.

Whoever then humbles himself as this child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. And whoever receives one such child in My name receives Me; but whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to stumble, it would be better for him to have a heavy millstone hung around his neck, and to be drowned in the depth of the sea.

      <p>Does your church have one statement of faith for elders and a different one for members?  Are you so sure this is a good idea?<br /><br />Dr. R. Scott Clark writes,<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;It is not obvious that establishing two levels of subscription, one for  laity and another for ordained officers, is either biblical or  consistent with the Reformation.  From where in Scripture would one  deduce that God expects one level of subscription for officers and  another for laity?  Certainly it is possible for one to be a Christian  without affirming every proposition in the Reformed confession, but that  is beside the point.  On that rationale, why should we bother  establishing Reformed congregations at all? If the Reformed confession  defines what it is to be Reformed, then establishing two distinct  relations to the same constitutional document would seem to be a recipe  for confusion and effectively two churches within one.

Rushdoony:<br /><div><blockquote>Considered the father of Christian  Reconstructionism, Rushdoony has stated, “All the basic governmental  powers in society, save one, the death penalty, have been given [by God]  to the family, not to the state nor to the church....A mark of  anti-Christianity is the move to strip the family of these powers.” In  response to this idea, voices such as <i>Patriarch</i> magazine promote  “home education, home business, home church, home birth, family  ministry, family health, family worship...courtship and betrothal,  family-based welfare.” This view of the family may also include  rejection of organized sports, church youth and singles’ groups, and  neighborhood playmates.<br /></blockquote></div>(If you didn't know, theonomy is bad.  We're talking like  taking sinners out and stoning them in the streets like the Pharisees  did.  Bad.  How come so many people who claim to be Christians skip the  New Testament entirely?  "He who is without sin cast the first stone!")<br /><br />Ramer continues:<br /><div><blockquote><i>Patriarch</i> further suggests that  youth groups and Sunday school programs demonstrate a “failure of the  church to teach the principles of parental responsibility for child  training and to reinforce it in the church’s programs,” and that the use  of these programs in a church “may well be a reason to leave.”<br /></blockquote></div>I have a problem with  youth groups that coincide with normal Lord's Day worship services, because they  create a "church within a church", and the young people don't receive  the benefits of being influenced by older Christian brothers and  sisters.  They grow up and form "college/young adult" churches with the  same kind of music they're used to, and church for them becomes an  affinity club rather than the diverse, cross-cultural,  multi-generational legacy with historical roots that it's supposed to  be.  But I do not at all think that the presence of a youth group or  Sunday school justify leaving a church.<br /><br />In  the Reformed understanding of ecclesiology, the two functions of the  local church are the preaching of the Word and the officiating of the  Sacraments.  For the Reformed, the only valid means for leaving a church  are over 1) improper handling of the Word, and 2) improper handling of  the Sacraments.  Al Mohler <a href="http://www.ligonier.org/learn/articles/should-i-stay-or-should-i-go/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">writes</a>,<br />               <div><blockquote>         Church shopping violates the integrity of the church and the meaning   of church membership. When members leave for insufficient reason, the  fellowship of the church is broken, its witness is weakened, and the  peace and unity of the congregation are sacrificed. Tragically, a  superficial understanding of church membership undermines our witness to  the gospel of Christ.<br /><br />There is no  excuse for this phenomenon. We have no right to leave a  church over preferences about music, personal taste, or even programming  that does not meet expectations.  These controversies or concerns  should prompt the faithful Christian to consider how he might be of  assistance in finding and forging a better way, rather than working to  find an excuse to leave.<br /><br />Christians  cannot look to this question as merely a matter of  consumerism. We are called to love the church and to pray for its peace  and unity, not to look for an opportunity to move to  another congregation.<br /><br />There are times,  however, when it is right to separate from a  congregation or denomination. But in such a case, the issue is not taste  but theology.</blockquote></div>   We have the Reformed confessions as our standards,  whether they be the Belgic Confession, the Heidelberg Catechism, the  Westmister Confession and Catechisms, or the 1689 London Baptist  Confession, as excellent summaries of the system of doctrine taught in  God's Word.  If what you're teaching about a given text differs  substantially from what's taught in those documents, then you might want  to reconsider your interpretation, because people have been thinking  about these things for a couple thousand years now.<br /><br />Ramer quotes my hero, Michael Horton, with his view of the  doctrine of the "two kingdoms":<br /><div><blockquote>Fourth,  <i>Christ and culture in paradox</i> sees the kingdom of God and the  kingdom of humankind as “different spheres with different  purposes....Culture can never be an avenue of finding God....But neither  can culture be an object of disgust, since culture never promises to  save or redeem.” In this view, while not all pleasurable aspects of life  are spiritual in the salvific or godly sense, God is still present in  them.<br /></blockquote></div>Horton  says <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100304174349/http://www.matthiasmedia.com.au:80/briefing/longing/5402/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">elsewhere</a>:<br /><div><blockquote>This  view says that every Christian is a citizen of two cities—the City  of God and the City of Man. Each of these spheres is separate, and they  have different purposes. Luther expressed this idea in his doctrine of  the ‘two kingdoms’. On this model, one cannot coerce faith, nor can one  accommodate faith to secular modes of thought. However, it's possible to  live out one's faith in the light of special revelation so that the  wider culture can experience the influence of Christianity. Calvin and  Augustine also expressed similar ideas.</blockquote></div>This is reflected in the Westminster Confessions' admission  of the distinct spheres of the civil magistrate and the church  government, and it coincides with Romans 13, which says that the civil  magistrate is not your enemy, but your guardian—unless, of course,  you're behaving wickedly, in which case he becomes the rod of God (used  figuratively, as I believe it is usually is in Scripture, except Exodus  21:20, of course) to chasten you.<br /><br />So all those  "Christians" who tell you not to watch good movies, or to  listen to good  music, and instead they advocate watching Kirk Cameron  movies and  listening to K-Love...  Yeah, that stuff sucks.  And the  "Christian"  rock stars are up to just as much no-good backstage as the  "worldly"  counterparts who they're trying to sound like.  Luther said  to the  Christian shoemaker, make a good shoe and sell it at a fair  price.  He  didn't say, put a cross on it, charge 10% more, and market  it as a  Christian shoe, if you can't make it in the "secular"  marketplace.  <i>Gah!</i><br /><br />(In summary: if you're going to listen  to rock, listen to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WZB944?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=lbmusic&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000WZB944">good  stuff</a><img class=" ojroqhqczymfqlqgnudh ojroqhqczymfqlqgnudh  ojroqhqczymfqlqgnudh ojroqhqczymfqlqgnudh ojroqhqczymfqlqgnudh ojroqhqczymfqlqgnudh ojroqhqczymfqlqgnudh ojroqhqczymfqlqgnudh ojroqhqczymfqlqgnudh ojroqhqczymfqlqgnudh ojroqhqczymfqlqgnudh ojroqhqczymfqlqgnudh ojroqhqczymfqlqgnudh ojroqhqczymfqlqgnudh ojroqhqczymfqlqgnudh ojroqhqczymfqlqgnudh ojroqhqczymfqlqgnudh" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=lbmusic&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000WZB944" alt="" border="0" height="1" width="1" />.)<br /><br />We've  already seen examples of the dispensationalist fear-mongering by the  Pearls, telling people if they don't beat their children, they're going  to line up to get the Mark of the Beast tattooed on.  Or they're going  to be lulled into a drug-induced slumber by the New World Order.<br /><div><blockquote>The Pearls also tell  parents, “Fail to use the rod on [a disobedient, bullying child] and you  are creating a ‘Nazi.’” Fear of producing a Nazi may compel parents to  use a “rod” even when their intuition tells them there is a better  option in a particular situation.<br /></blockquote></div>Did anybody else read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wave_%28novel%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>The  Wave</i></a> in high school?<br /><br />This  whole regimented thing is much more like the Hitler Youth than anything  else.  Conformity.  Do what you're told or you'll get a beating.  No  questions, etc.  But wait, there's more:<br /><div><blockquote>“You  must look for opportunities to demonstrate that you have the last word,  that your authority is to be obeyed without question....If, during the  course of a day, no contest arises naturally, you should arrange one.  Seek opportunity to thwart the child’s will, to cause him to submit to  your command.”<br /></blockquote></div>Are  you seriously going to pick a fight with your little kid?  Come on  people, use some discernment!  Throw those crappy books away!<br /><br />"Fathers, do not exasperate your children, so that they will not lose  heart" (Col. 3:21, ESV).<br /><br />You know  how every single time a pastor comes to a text about God as Father, he  has to apologize because he knows that most people probably don't have  good fathers.  And it's because of people like Rushdoony and Pearl, and  all those who advocate their teachings.  If it weren't for those who  twist scripture in order to justify their own abuse, we wouldn't have to  have caveats when we teach on the Fatherhood of God.<br /><br />HT: <a href="http://parentingfreedom.com/2010/02/15/murder-by-discipline-children-investigators-were-led-to-no-greater-joy-ministries-michael-and-debi-pearl-that-espouses-spanking-as-a-necessary-part-of-training-ones-child/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Parenting Freedom</a><a href="http://parentingfreedom.com/2010/02/15/murder-by-discipline-children-investigators-were-led-to-no-greater-joy-ministries-michael-and-debi-pearl-that-espouses-spanking-as-a-necessary-part-of-training-ones-child/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><br /></a></div>

She had been running a small paralegal business; her co-workers had been car salespeople, or had worked in telemarketing. They were prized for their ability to hustle on the ground and “look you in the eye when they shook your hand,” she surmised. As a reward for good performance, the bank would sometimes send a Hummer limo to pick up Jacobson for a celebration, she said. She’d arrive at a bar and find all her co-workers drunk and her boss “doing body shots off a waitress.”<br /><br />The idea of reaching out to churches took off quickly, Jacobson recalls. The branch managers figured pastors had a lot of influence with their parishioners and could give the loan officers credibility and new customers. Jacobson remembers a conference call where sales managers discussed the new strategy. The plan was to send officers to guest-speak at church-sponsored “wealth-building seminars” like the ones Bowler attended, and dazzle the participants with the possibility of a new house. They would tell pastors that for every person who took out a mortgage, $350 would be donated to the church, or to a charity of the parishioner’s choice. “They wouldn’t say, ‘Hey, Mr. Minister. We want to give your people a bunch of subprime loans,” Jacobson told me. “They would say, ‘Your congregants will be homeowners! They will be able to live the American dream!’”&lt;/blockquote&gt;HT - <a href="http://www.marshillchurch.org/media/luke/jesus-without-sin">Mark Driscoll</a>&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <p>Alistair Begg says: &lt;blockquote&gt;General Jackson is a legend in American History.  Any of you who have read of Jackson know that he was a man of extreme principle and character.  At the very heart of this was his conviction of faith in Jesus Christ.  And his extreme rigorous character attached itself also to the observance of the Sabbath.  And writing in his <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=D_BSA0GZn8QC&amp;pg=PA74&amp;ei=MOAvS7rAFYuolQSOxejSAw&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false">biography</a>, his widow says,&lt;blockquote&gt;Certainly he was not less scrupulous in obeying the divine command to “remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy” than he was in any other rule of his life. Since the Creator had set apart this day for his own, and commanded it to be kept holy, he believed that it was as wrong for him to desecrate it by worldly pleasure, idleness, or secular employment, as to break any other commandment of the decalogue. Sunday was his busiest day of the week, as he always attended church twice a day and taught in two Sabbath schools! He refrained as much as possible from all worldly conversation, and in his family, if secular topics were introduced, he would say, with a kindly smile, “We will talk about that to-morrow.”<br /><br />He never travelled on Sunday, never took his mail from the post-office, nor permitted a letter of his own to travel on that day, always before posting it calculating the time it required to reach its destination; and even business letters of the utmost importance were never sent off the very last of the week, but were kept over until Monday morning, unless it was a case where distance required a longer time than a week.<br /><br />One so strict in his own Sabbath observance naturally believed that it was wrong for the government to carry the mails on Sunday. Any organization which exacted secular labor of its employees on the Lord’s day was, in his opinion, a violator of God’s law.&lt;/blockquote&gt;And so his life was marked by a rigorous obedience to the Law of God.  Now, loved ones, here’s the question: Is this quote from Jackson an anachronism?  In other words, if Jackson was right, where does that leave us?  Cos’ if we’re right, most of us, he was wrong.  But one thing is for sure: we’re not both right.  – Alistair Begg, <i><span class="removed_link" title="http://s3.amazonaws.com/tflmedia/free_downloads/1692-holydayorholidaypartone.mp3">Holy Day or Holiday?</span></i>, sermon&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</p>

<p>When Latitude was first released for the iPhone as a web app, I was  <br />unimpressed, because it appeared to be using the cell-tower- <br />triangulation method of finding your location rather than the GPS  <br />coordinates. But I loaded it up today, and it's 100% accurate even as  <br />I walk down the street!&lt;p&gt;I don't know if they fixed a bug, or whether this was caused by an  <br />erronneous setting on AT&amp;T's end that caused their system to think  <br />that my new iPhone 3G was actually my old first-generation iPhone (we  <br />got that straightened out after MMS went live).&lt;p&gt;Sent from my iPhone&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;<img width="1" height="1" src="" alt="" />&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <p>Richard Gaffin, quoted by Rev. Kim Riddlebarger in <span style="font-style:italic;">A Case for Amillenialism:</span></p>
<blockquote>The unity of the resurrection of Christ and the resurrection of believers is such that the latter consists of two episodes in the experience of the individual believer—one which is already past, already realized [e.g. <a href="http://www.gnpcb.org/esv/search/?q=Colossians+2">Col. 2:12</a>: “having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the powerful working of God, who raised him from the dead”], and one which is future, yet to be realized [e.g. <a href="http://www.gnpcb.org/esv/search/?q=Colossians+3">Col. 3:4</a>: “When Christ who is your life appears, then you also will appear with him in glory.”]. In the period between the resurrection and the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=LJ1c9We_ay8C&amp;lpg=PA992&amp;ots=fLYX6KtSZm&amp;dq=bible%20dictionary%20parousia&amp;pg=PA992#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false">Parousia</a> of Christ, any believer is one who has already been raised from the dead, and is yet to be raised. . . . The distinctive notion that the <span style="font-style:italic;">eschatos</span>, the “age-to-come,” is both present and future, is reflected in [Paul’s] teaching concerning the fundamental eschatological occurrence for the individual believer: his resurrection is both already and not yet. (67)</blockquote>
<p>This passage really helps explain how Jesus’ kingdom is already realized, though we await the final consummation.</p>

      <p>“True saints have their minds, in the first place, inexpressibly pleased and delighted with the sweet ideas of the glorious and amiable nature of the things of God. And this is the spring of all their delights, and the cream of all their pleasures: it is the joy of their joy. This sweet and ravishing entertainment they have in the view of the beautiful and delightful nature of divine things, is the foundation of the joy that they have afterwards, in the consideration of their being theirs. But the dependence of the affections of hypocrites is in a contrary order: they first rejoice and are elevated with it, that they are made so much of by God; and then on that ground he seems, in a sort, lovely to them.” —Jonathan Edwards</p>

      <p>You may remember my recent <a href="https://www.devlord.io/blog/2009/10/11/eschatology-panel-at-bethlehem-baptist-church/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post</a> about the “Evening of Eschatology” at Bethlehem Baptist. Justin Taylor posted recently on <a href="http://thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/justintaylor/2009/10/06/what-you-must-believe-if-you-are-a-premillennialist" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What You Must Believe if You Are a Premillennialist</a>, and included a lengthy chapter (really too long for a blog post) reprinted from a Sam Storms work-in-progress. Then Jim Hamilton posted a <a href="http://jimhamilton.wordpress.com/2009/10/07/response-to-jt-on-what-premillennialists-must-believe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rebuttal</a>, reiterating his argument from the panel discussion: that at the time of Christ, there were a lot of people, including Zealots and Rabbis, who believed the Messiah was supposed to come and establish his earthly kingdom on the throne of David; but, as it turns out, he didn’t come to do that <em>the first time</em>. In Hamilton’s view, Jesus is going to do all the things the Jews expected the second time around, when he returns to sit on the throne of David in the Millennium. Hamilton says this principle of expecting the fulfillment too soon is the same when it comes to the end times: that Scripture may lead Amillennialists to think that the consummation will happen at the Second Advent, but, as Hamilton says, it’s not going to happen until a thousand years later.</p>
<div></div>
<div>This argument falls flat with anyone who's not a dispensationalist. We interpret the Old Testament in light of the New Testament. We see the Old Testament kingdom and sacerdotal system as <em>types and shadows</em> of the ultimate realities, which are heavenly, and we do not see a legitimacy for a return to the Old Testament types and shadows. We do not see a gap between the First Advent and the coming of the Kingdom. We see Christ as having come as King <em>already</em>. As <a href="http://links.christreformed.org/realaudio/A20090925-Amillenialism.mp3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kim Riddlebarger put it</a> recently, his victory over sin and death is so much a bigger deal than a king kicking the Romans out of Palestine and ruling over a tiny strip of land in the Middle East. (I highly recommend that <a href="http://links.christreformed.org/realaudio/A20090925-Amillenialism.mp3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mp3</a> by Kim Riddlebarger about the Kingdom, by the way.)</div>
<p>Riddlebarger quotes Anthony Hoekema and George Eldon Ladd, who said the kingdom of God is to be understood as God’s kingly reign over his people as well as the universe. He also says when Jesus said “the kingdom is at hand”, it was literally “right under your noses.” Its coming has already begun, and Reformed Christians believe it will finally be consummated when Christ returns.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2009/10/11/eschatology-panel-at-bethlehem-baptist-church/">Eschatology Panel at Bethlehem Baptist Church</a></h2>
      <p>John Piper asked some teachers to remain after the Desiring God conference for a panel discussion on the three views of the millennium in Revelation 20.  The audio, video, etc., can be found <a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/Blog/2038_audio_and_video_for_eschatology_conversation/">here</a>.  Sam Storms argues the amillennial view based on Paul’s description of the abolishment of death in 1 Cor. 15 (“The last enemy to be destroyed is death.” v. 26, ESV). His interpretation of Revelation 20 is the same as what I’ve read from B.B. Warfield: the millennial reign of the saints refers to the martyrs in the “intermediate state”, before the throne of God above.  Doug Wilson argues the Post-millennial view, declaring that we are moving towards a “Golden Age” where the Gospel will have a literal reign on the earth. Jim Hamilton argues the historical Pre-millennial view. His interpretation of Revelation 20 is something that you “make room for”, and “use your imagination”.  He says that just as the Gospels say Judas was hanged, but Acts says he “fell headlong”; and in the same way, his interpretation of Revelation 20 does not require conformity with the rest of Scripture (e.g. what Paul and Jesus say), but is something that can be added.  John Piper tries to hold it all together and maintain unity through it all.<br /><br />The two-hour session is a good overview for the different perspectives for those who don’t know where they stand as well as those who have picked a team but need to know more about what the others say.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;<img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2602771351651662379-6032293557156052371?l=mustfollow.blogspot.com" alt="" />&lt;/div&gt;</p>

<p>I was particularly struck by a story about Edwards’ 8-month internship at a Presbyterian church in New York City (at which time he wrote the <span style="font-style:italic;">Resolutions</span>). This small congregation had split from its parent church not because of theological or doctrinal agreements (they had none), but because of matters of polity. After 8 months under Edwards’ preaching, Lawson said, the congregation decided to return to the very church they had left.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2009/09/15/what-the-lcms-says-about-body-modification/">What the LCMS says about Body Modification</a></h2>
      <p>For body-modified Christians like myself, here is a helpful <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.lcms.org/pages/internal.asp?NavID=2169">answer</span> from the Q&amp;A of the Lutheran Missouri Synod (a.k.a. the good guys) that emphasizes the difference between the moral law and the ceremonial law.<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;I[t] should be kept in mind that the prohibition in Leviticus 19:28–“Do not cut your bodies for the dead or put tattoo marks on yourselves. I am the Lord”–belongs to Old Testament levitical or ceremonial law–which has been set aside or annulled with the coming of Christ (Col. 2:16-17; Acts 15). Leviticus is full of such laws, including the command one verse earlier: “Do not cut the hair at the sides of your head or clip off the edges of your beard.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;It falls into the “weaker brother” category from Romans 14.  Of course we don’t want to offend our brothers.  But there are levels of appropriateness in terms of avoiding offense.  For example, if you have a visible tattoo, say, on your neck, and the only way to cover it up is to wear a scarf or turtleneck, <i>in the summer</i>… the more appropriate way brothers to deal with offense might be to deal with prejudice and legalism in the weaker brother instead. If such a one is offended by a Christian with body modifications, is this person going to be crippled from being able to minister to unbelievers downtown or in the soup lines?<br /><br />Martin Luther wrote in his commentary on Galatians, “This difference between the Law and the Gospel is the height of knowledge in Christendom.”  As church leaders, whenever we have the opportunity to stifle legalism, perfectionism, and man-made religion, we owe it to our beloved church to take that step.  As covenant theology types, we believe the Gospel preached by Christ and his Apostles was the same message of salvation given by God in covenant to Abraham and David, who put their trust in the Messiah who was to come. We know that “by the works of the law no one will be justified,” but Scripture also says if we love him, we will obey his commands. We are told all over the New Testament to pursue righteousness, to be obedient, and to avoid sin, and the moral law is where God defines righteousness and sin.  So we want to do all we can to make sure we understand the difference between God’s binding moral law (his commands), and the temporary, localized ceremonial laws of the Old Testament, so that we can spur one another on toward sanctification and yet not burden each other with burdens too hard to bear.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;<img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2602771351651662379-187216958040042891?l=mustfollow.blogspot.com" alt="" />&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <blockquote>Maybe you don't want to accept Jesus Christ and would rather go the hard way [i.e., through the seven-year tribulation].  You'll have to find some means of surviving for seven years without depending on this corrupt society.  This society will be totally taken over by the Antichrist.  No one will be able to buy or sell except he has his mark.  If you take the mark, you are lost forever.<br /><br />The best plan is probably to take off for the jungles of Mexico and learn how to live off the land.  Just do your best to survive down there.  I would suggest the remote areas of Oregon, but I don't know how you'd survive the winters.  (Chuck Smith, <i>What the World Is Coming To</i>, Maranatha House, 1977, 198-199)</blockquote>
<p>There are so many problems with this, but I will just mention a couple.  First of all, if you are a pre-tribulational, pre-millennialist, you should not be offering people an alternative to accepting Jesus as Lord.  God is going to judge wickedness, and you should not offer people any way out of that judgment other than salvation in Christ alone.<br /><br />Beyond that, you have to wonder, every single time a democrat gets elected president, whether Chuck Smith followers believe it’s the antichrist and move out to Mexico or the Oregonian outback precisely because of what Chuck Smith said.  How many families are holed up in compounds in the middle of nowhere, avoiding taxation, etc., because of this kind of teaching?<br /><br />In contrast to this, Romans 13:1-8 (ESV) says: &lt;blockquote&gt;Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God. Therefore whoever resists the authorities resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment.  For rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Would you have no fear of the one who is in authority? Then do what is good, and you will receive his approval,  for he is God’s servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword in vain. For he is the servant of God, an avenger who carries out God’s wrath on the wrongdoer.  Therefore one must be in subjection, not only to avoid God’s wrath but also for the sake of conscience.  For because of this you also pay taxes, for the authorities are ministers of God, attending to this very thing.  Pay to all what is owed to them: taxes to whom taxes are owed, revenue to whom revenue is owed, respect to whom respect is owed, honor to whom honor is owed.&lt;/blockquote&gt;HT: <a href="http://kimriddlebarger.squarespace.com/the-latest-post/2009/9/6/who-said-that.html">Kim Riddlebarger</a>&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;<img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2602771351651662379-5992093740967665146?l=mustfollow.blogspot.com" alt="" />&lt;/div&gt;</p>

<blockquote>In preparation for Mark, I think I've read about 30 commentators... Most of them are dead writers. Because I honor the work of the Spirit of God in the past. I have great respect for the illumination of the Spirit on great godly students of Scripture in the past... The critical doctrines, the critical truths of Scripture, have long before me been interpreted accurately. And when I come up with something that nobody's ever said, gag me.</blockquote>

Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth.  For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.  When Christ who is your  life appears, then you also will appear with him in glory.<br /><br />Put to death therefore what is earthly in you: sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry.  On account of these the wrath of God is coming.  In these you too once walked, when you were living in them.  But now you must put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and obscene talk from your mouth.  Do not lie to one another, seeing that you have put off the old self with its practices and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge after the image of its creator.  Here there is not Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free; but Christ is all, and in all.<br /><br />Put on then, as God's chosen ones, holy and beloved, compassionate hearts, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience, bearing with one another and, if one has a complaint against another, forgiving each other; as the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must forgive. And above all these put on love, which binds everything together in perfect harmony.  And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which indeed you were called in one body. And be thankful.  Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, with thankfulness in your hearts to God.  And whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.  (Colossians 3:1-17, ESV)</blockquote>

      <h2><a href="/2009/07/25/the-law-in-romans/">The Law in Romans</a></h2>
      <blockquote>The Holy Spirit creates this desire [for holiness], not only by showing us our sins, but also by showing us God's standard of holiness.  He does this through the Scriptures.  As we read and study the Scriptures or hear them taught, we are captivated by the moral beauty of God's standard of holiness.  Even though His standard may seem far beyond us, we recognize and respond to that which is "holy, righteous, and good" (Romans 7:12).  Even though we fail so often, in our inner being we "delight in God's law" (Romans 7:22). (Jerry Bridges, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Pursuit of Holiness</span>, p. 74)</blockquote>
<p>There is a tendency for some Christians to look at the Law with hatred, as towards a former slavemaster, instead of looking at it as the beautiful standard of God’s holiness.  One of the things that I appreciate about covenant theology is its respect for the Old Testament law, not as an alternate path, nor as the thing that Jesus came to rescue us from, but rather, as part of the progressive revelation of the gospel.  In Romans 7:14, Paul says that “the law is spiritual, but I am of the flesh”–the problem is not with the law, but with the fleshly striving to obey it, because it cannot be obeyed in the flesh.  In other words, our contempt should be aimed at our carnality, and not at the law.<br /><br />I’m reading Romans again, and one thing that is standing out to me this time is that the dualistic view of the flesh and the spirit, which applies to us as human beings, is also applied to the law.   “For the <span style="font-style:italic;">law</span> of the Spirit of life has set you free in Christ Jesus from the <span style="font-style:italic;">law</span> of sin and death” (Rom. 8:2, ESV).  These are not separate laws, like Jesus=good vs. Moses=bad, but rather, this is the same law, which in the spirit shows us the moral beauty of God, but in the flesh brings death because of the Original Sin which prevents us from fulfilling it on our own.<br /><br />“For the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God, for it does not submit to God’s law; indeed it cannot.  Those who are in the flesh cannot please God” (8:7-8, ESV).  Clearly, obedience “to God’s law” is equated with “pleasing God.”  We are to please God by obeying his law, and this is not something we can do ourselves, but requires the indwelling Spirit of God (v. 9).  In this way, God gets all the glory.  (Side note: I’m not talking about ultimate, saving justification here.  It is Christ’s substitutionary death in our place which satisfies God’s wrath towards sin, and Christ’s righteousness is imputed on us, so that God is, in that sense, pleased by the fulfilling of the law in Christ on our behalf.)<br /><br />This is what Paul means in chapter 9 when he talks about children of the flesh vs. children of the promise.  It does not mean Arabs vs. Jews.  It means those who try to obey in vain out of the flesh vs. the elect, who are regenerated and are obedient and righteous by the Spirit.  “They did not pursue it by faith, but as if it were based on works” (9:32, ESV).<br /><br />“For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law who will be justified [cf. James 2:20 ‘faith without works is dead’: the works are the fruit of justifying faith].  For when Gentiles, who do not have the law, <span style="font-style:italic;">by nature</span> do what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law.  They show that the work of the law is written on their hearts…” (2:13-15a, ESV).  This “written on their hearts” is the new nature, the New Covenant from Jeremiah 31:31-34, which is available to Gentiles as well as Jews!  The law, which is spiritual, does not change, so the covenant is essentially the same.  The difference in Jeremiah is that the Lord is promising to <span style="font-style:italic;">regenerate</span> a remnant of his people (cf. Rom. 11:5).  Spiritual, regenerate obedience (from the heart) was always the point.  Throughout Israel’s history, all those who obeyed by the Spirit and did not fail by the flesh were the elect.  The key for the believer is that the law is written on your heart, so when you obey, you are actually seeking your heart’s desire (cf. John Piper’s “Christian hedonism”).  This is the active sovereign grace of God!<br /><br />It all comes down to the doctrines of grace, which applied 3,000 years ago just as they do today.  “So then it depends not on human will or exertion, but on God, who has mercy” (Rom. 9:16, ESV).&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width=’1’ height=’1’ src=”https://www.devlord.io/blog/the-law-in-romans/”’ /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</p>

Lewis despite their estrangement and even unbelief (something Piper <a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/ResourceLibrary/AskPastorJohn/ByTopic/40/3903_Should_a_pastor_continue_in_ministry_if_one_of_his_children_proves_to_be_an_unbeliever/">knows a lot</a> about himself):&lt;blockquote&gt;Amazingly, both Stevenson’s and Lewis’s fathers kept on sending stipends to their sons through the years of rejection. In spite of words like, “I am simply incapable of cohabiting any house with my father” (Stevenson); and, “I really can’t face him” (Lewis), the fathers kept supporting their sons.<br /><br />Six years after his father’s death, Lewis wrote to a friend to catch him up on the last decade: “My father is dead…. I have deep regrets about all my relations with my father (but thank God they were best at the end). I am going bald. I am a Christian.”<br /><br />Perhaps sending money through the broken years was the right thing to do. Perhaps not. What it shows is not approval, nor that the sorrow had disappeared. Rather, it reveals a kind of bond between fathers and sons that is the foundation of pain, not its removal.&lt;/blockquote&gt;<a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/ResourceLibrary/TasteAndSee/ByDate/2009/4101_The_Sorrows_of_Fathers_and_Sons/">Read the whole thing</a>.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;<img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2602771351651662379-5335651385537410516?l=mustfollow.blogspot.com" alt="" />&lt;/div&gt;</p>

<p>My experience is that God brings deliverance from these things gradually. Because his purpose is to strengthen faith and character. A different analogy: it is similar to endurance and strength training. It’s the adversity of the struggle that builds spiritual understanding, muscle, and endurance.

First we have the covenant of promise, in which God promises a Messiah through which he will provide justification by faith alone (Genesis 15:6), which is typified by Mount Zion and Sarah.  Then there is the covenant of law, given by Moses on Mount Sinai and typified by Ishmael’s mother Hagar.  One deals with freedom and true, miraculous sonship, and the other with slavery and striving according to the flesh.  One corresponds to the ancient “royal grant”, in which a free gift is bestowed upon the vassal with all the work is performed by another, and the other corresponds to the suzerainty treaty, in which the benefits are conditional upon the performance of the vassal and harsh sanctions are imposed if the vassal should fail.<br /><br />One of the things that makes the chapter difficult is that Horton quotes some liberal-sounding textual critics who seem to look down on God’s servants Moses and the reformer king Josiah as if they had totally dropped the ball.  My brothers, we cannot approach Scripture in this way.  Moses gave the Law not of his own volition, but the Law came directly from the mouth of Yahweh (“And God spoke all these words, saying, ‘I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery. You shall have no other gods before me…’” Exodus 20:1-3, ESV, cf. 2 Peter 1:20-21).  These commandments were not given by men, and that is something we must remember whenever we look at the Torah.  Secondly, when we contrast these covenants we need to remember that they are simultaneous; there are not two “dispensations” for different people in different times, but they run concurrently.  This unity can also be observed in the accepted fact that Moses wrote the first five books of the Bible, so the people’s representative in the Sinaitic covenant was the same one who wrote about God’s covenant with Abraham in Genesis 15.   Finally, the issue with these covenants is where does justification come from.  It does not come (in either covenant) by obeying the works of the law, but by identification (e.g. through baptism and the covenant ritual meal passed down to us in the Lord’s Supper, though these actions do not justify us but are symbolic of spiritual realities) with the One who fulfilled the covenant of law completely.  In him the two covenants come together, as he was both promised and typified in both of them.<br /><br />I submit that the issue at hand is that the religious performance of the Law without receiving the promise of justification by faith alone is meaningless, and even increases condemnation.  I see the “royal grant” covenants of Noah, Abraham, and David as a thread that runs throughout history, with the law covenant as something clarified in the middle of them, but the thread of the promise continued to run.  It’s like looking at a sound wave file when you are editing music.  You see the foundation of a pedal bass, but when other music is added on top of it, the bass continues, and when the music fades, the pedal bass remains.  The bass is the basis for the music, and without it the music wouldn’t know its proper limits.  The music grows out of the bass, just as obedience to God’s law is completely impossible for depraved humanity, and can only happen as the fruit of regeneration.  (Another way to illustrate the concurrency of the covenant of law and the covenant of promise is the relationship between the invisible church and the visible church: although people may profess to be partakers of the covenant, only God knows to whom it actually applies.)<br /><br />The problem with the Pharisees in Jesus’ day, as well as the Galatian Judaizers whom Paul contended with, was that they were focusing on imitating the fruit externally, with no regard for the basis of justification which is only through the blood sacrifice of the spotless Lamb of God.  “Salvation has always come through a covenant of grace (founded on an eternal and unilateral covenant of redemption), rather than on a contract or one’s personal fulfillment of the law” (p. 36).  They were going about it in the wrong direction, imitating the effects of justification with no regard to the cause.  “Now to him who works, the wages are not counted as grace but as debt. But to him who does not work but believes on Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is accounted for righteousness” (Romans 4:4-5, NKJV).  No points will ever be scored by our outward obedience, but the performance of them, because they are done in hypocrisy, actually count against us! (the “debt” in Rom. 4:4), earning us a worse punishment in Hell than if we had lived our lives in blatant apostasy.  As Horton says, “This covenant does not grade on a curve but requires absolute, perfect, personal obedience to everything in it” (p. 38). Paul says elsewhere in Romans 3:20 (ESV), “For by works of the law no human being will be justified in his sight, since through the law comes knowledge of sin” (cf. 7:7-12). Because of indwelling sin we must be cleansed and have the righteousness of Christ imputed to us. Only then, by his Spirit working within us, we will be able to bear the fruits worthy of repentance (Luke 3:8).<br /><br />In the Sinaitic covenant, “there is no formal obligation on Yahweh’s part” (quoting Hillers on p. 39), but the emphasis is on the obedience of the people (which we must recognize as fruit and also as the standard which only Christ can meet).  In contrast, the Abrahamic covenant in Genesis 15 is all on God.  Horton again quotes Hillers:<br /></p>

      <p>I am getting ready to post on another Chapter from Michael Horton’s <span style="font-style:italic;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/080107195X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=lbmusic&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=080107195X">Introducing Covenant Theology</a></span><span style="font-style:italic;">,</span> and I thought it might be helpful to clear up a couple things about covenant theology before we dig deeper into the book.<br /><br />In Reformed theology, we see three covenants in Scripture: Redemption, Works, and Grace.  The Covenant of Redemption is between the members of the Triune Godhead, by which God made a pact with himself in eternity past that he would carry out his redemptive purposes in history.  Now, where do we place the other two covenants in Scripture?<br /><br />Many modern Christians seem to confuse the theological understandings of the Covenant of Works and the Covenant of Grace in a way that I think is quite unhelpful.  Typically, when these terms are first heard, the understanding goes that the Covenant of Works is equal to the Mosaic Law, or the Old Testament, and the Covenant of Grace is equal to the “New Covenant” through faith in Christ’s atonement, or the New Testament.<br /><br />While it is true that the Covenent of Grace is based on the atonement of Christ, what many Christians do not realize is that the traditional Reformed understanding of these covenants is completely different from what they would think.<br /><br />The Covenant of Works refers only to the covenant God made with Adam in the Garden of Eden, in Genesis 3:15-17 (ESV):<br /></p>

      <p>Dr. Timothy George on the embracing of Reformed theology by young people:&lt;blockquote&gt;Some of them haven’t read anything by R.C. Sproul or any of the famous reformed apologists that are out there today. They’ve just been reading the Bible, and reading it with an open mind and an open heart and this is where they’ve come….<br /><br />I think it’s an encouraging sign to me that among young people especially the older denominational paradigm of, “Let’s build a great church. Let’s put up our fences. Let’s say that we’re the biggest and the best,” you know, that old “Rah! Rah! Rah!” ecclesiology, doesn’t sell very well. I think, in particular, we spend too much time building fences around our backyard and not tending to the foundation on which the building stands. We paint our fences, we hold them up – “I’m this, not that!” – and, in the meantime, the foundations are being eroded. And what you sense and what I’m sensing, I think, is a renewed interest in the foundations. Reformed theology is a way of talking about that. It’s a way of getting in touch with the reality of the faith, with God, with the Scriptures, with Jesus Christ and salvation, with the mission of the church in the world. Reformed theology, at its best, is about those things. It’s not about, “I’m a Baptist, not a Presbyterian,” or, “I’m this kind of Baptist, not that kind of Baptist,” or, “I’m a conservative, not a moderate,” or, “I’m a moderate, not a conservative.” Those types of old-fashioned political distinctions, I think, no longer have the bite they used to.

      <p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/horton_ict.jpg"><img src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/horton_ict.jpg?w=199" alt="" border="0" /></a>In the second half of chapter 2 in <span style="font-style:italic;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/080107195X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=lbmusic&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=080107195X">Introducing Covenant Theology</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=lbmusic&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=080107195X" alt="" border="0" height="1" width="1" /></span>, Michael Horton drills down towards the characteristics of the biblical covenant.  It is founded on God’s transcendence, his sovereign election, and his grace, which is proclaimed loudly in his forbearance.<br /><br />The religion we see in Scripture is unlike the pagan religions because we see God as transcendent.  Horton writes, “According to the Bible, that relationship–a covenant–is established by God in his freedom.  We are not related to God by virtue of a common aspect of our being, but by virtue of a pact that he himself makes with us to be our God” (p. 29).  Our God is not arbitrary or capricious; he is sovereign and omniscient and personal and ultimately trustworthy.  History is “God’s theater in which he promised to bring about his purposes” (p. 30).  The religion is not man-made, and with a covenant with Yahweh as its foundation, the chief end of life is not the goals of the nation, but God’s sovereign will.  With such security, there is so much freedom.  “Far from engendering a legalistic form of religion, Israel’s covenant with Yahweh meant that they were no longer at the whim of petty warlords and heavy-handed suzerains” (p. 30).  This is key.  Covenant theology does not view Old Testament Judaism as legalistic, but as a relationship in which people had assurance that God would care for them.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">The Treaty at Sinai</span><br /><br />The oath at Mount Sinai closely parallels the suzerainty treaty.  The Ten Commandments are not just “another part” of “the Law”, but they are the stipulations of this covenant.  Exodus 24:3 says, “Moses came and told the people all the words of the Lord and all the rules.  And all the people answered with one voice and said, ‘All the words that the Lord has spoken we will do’” (ESV).  Yet, what happens right after Moses comes down from the mountain?<br /></p>

<blockquote>We must remember that God is the perfect Manager. He is efficient in his selection, calling people according to the gifts and talents that he has given them. Satan's strategy is to manipulate Christians into positions for which they have no ability or skill to perform well. Satan himself is very efficient in directing Christians to inefficiency and ineffectiveness.</blockquote>
<p>And…</p>
<blockquote>Often people apply for positions for which they have no skill. This is particularly and sadly true within the church and related Christian service. Some hunger and thirst to be in full-time Christian service, but lack the ability and the gifts required for the particular job. For example, they may have the academic training and credentials for the pastorate but lack the managerial skills or the people skills to help make them effective pastors.</blockquote>

      <p>First I want to say what a blessing it is to have the door opened to covenant theology. I am learning so much and am so thankful. The discovery of the Reformed biblical framework is an amazing gift which empowers the student of Scripture to dig into it and learn for himself what the Spirit was actually communicating in Scripture to the original audience as well as to modern believers. With this understanding, we don’t need to just accept whatever we are taught, but we can actually go straight to the source and think critically and exegetically to try to come to the most proper interpretation of a passage.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2009/06/24/jesus-died-for-our-sins/">Jesus died for our sins</a></h2>
      <p>The Suffering Servant passage in Isaiah, especially chapter 53, is perhaps the most significant passage in Scripture, because the entire gospel is revealed in it. It is well-known and worth memorizing. That is an understatement. There is such a wealth of doctrine in the passage, but right now I’m just going to focus on one verse.</p>
<blockquote>Out of the anguish of his soul he shall see and be satisfied;
by his knowledge shall the righteous one, my servant,
make many to be accounted righteous,
and he shall bear their iniquities. (Isaiah 53:11, ESV)</blockquote>
<p>“Jesus died for your sins” is a common phrase known well to evangelicals. As long as I can remember in my walk, when I thought of Jesus Christ hanging on the cross, I thought of him as really, truly thinking of me and all the sins I would ever commit. Sometimes, after decades of listening to sermons and daily Bible reading, you know things, but you don’t remember why you know them. Maybe it’s just because you have matured to a certain level in your walk with the Lord that you don’t need to know the chapter and verse in order to know the truth of the doctrine. Despite this, however, I found it very encouraging to come across this verse in my current iteration of reading through the Bible.</p>

<p>Remember The Milk (RTM) is a productivity tool or task list to help in getting things done (GTD). Unfortunately, you have to pay $25/year in order to access it on your iPhone. One of the benefits it has is the ability to share tasks. For example, if my wife neede me to stop at the store on the way home, she could edit a shopping list and send it to me.&lt;p&gt;But now with the copy &amp; paste features in the new iPhone OS, any old thing can be used to keep track of a shopping list. (I usually just scroll way up on our text message history to see what I’m supposed to pick up. Now I can copy each thing to a note.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I was researching “GTD” apps, I came across <a href="http://webworkerdaily.com/2009/06/19/singletasking-the-next-trend-in-web-working/">an article</a> that said maybe multitasking isn’t the way to go.  Apparently “singletasking” is the next big thing in productivity, and the blog mentioned a site called Now Do This (<a href="http://www.nowdothis.com/">www.nowdothis.com</a>), which I think is brilliant in its simplicity. The site was created by the founder of Vimeo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The irony of all this–and my wife can testify to this–is that I discovered this app while dinking around on my iPhone while watching TV with my wife.  I wasn’t able to follow the show. So… singletasking is a discipline I still need to work on. This web app should help me with that!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Note: There’s an app in Apple’s App Store called Now Do This, but it was uploaded by an unknown company, which leads me to suspect it’s a knockoff. Besides, with the web app, I’m not limited to my iPhone, because I can use it on a plain old computer as well!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;P.S.

We also learn that the covenants God made with his people were structured the same way as these treaties, but with some major differences.  First, God as the deity was not called as witness, but he was the actual sovereign in the treaties.  Second, the covenant, especially in Genesis 15 and 17, imposed no obligations upon Abraham, but it was God himself who promised to carry out his promises.<br /><br />The form of the ancient suzerain-vassal treaty, or “suzerainty treaty,” was already well-established in the ancient Near East before the Bible was written.  This was God’s providence at work in history, because it provided a cultural context for those with whom he made his own covenants.  Horton explains, “A suzerain was a great king, like an emperor, while a vassal was what we would today call a ‘client state’” (p. 24).  The treaties from the Hittite Empire seem to parallel the covenants we find in Scripture, even using the phrase “oaths and bonds.”<br /><br />Horton gives examples of how such treaties would come about:<br /></p>

<p>Here is Susanna Spurgeon’s postscript to a particularly sad chapter in her husband’s autobiography, which recalled many of the terrible things people had said about him:<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;A strange serenity has brooded over my spirit as these chapters have recalled the heartless attacks made on God’s servant… for he is so safe now, “with God eternally shut in”…<br /><br />But at the time of their publication what a grievous affliction these slanders were to me! My heart alternately sorrowed over him, and flamed with indignation against his detractors. For a long time I wondered how I could set continual comfort before his eyes, till, at last I hit upon the expedient of having the following verses printed in large Old English type, and enclosed in a pretty Oxford frame.  (This was before the days of the illuminated mottoes which at present are so conspicuous in our homes, and so often silently speak a message from God to us.<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;“Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for My sake. Rejoice and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in Heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.” –<i>Matthew</i> v. 11, 12&lt;/blockquote&gt;The text was hung up in our own room and was read over by the dear preacher every morning,–fulfilling its purpose most blessedly, for it strengthened his heart, and enabled him to buckle on the invisible armour, whereby he could calmly walk among men, unruffled by their calumnies, and concerned only for their best and highest interests.  –<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=KJQEAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=spurgeon%20autobiography&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;pg=PA61&amp;ci=54,329,856,865&amp;source=bookclip"><i>The Autobiography of Charles H.

      <h2><a href="/2009/05/28/elders-in-every-church/">Elders in every church&#8230;</a></h2>
      <p>The church where we have providentially found ourselves is accepting elder nominations through the month of May, even as the pastor teaches a series on the character of a godly leader as laid out in Scripture. The order of worship handout actually has some lines at the bottom where you can write down the names of those you think should be elders, and then you can just drop it in the offertory box. They are deliberately making it easy for the congregation to bring to attention those who they see being called to leadership. It brings me great joy to see a young, small church wasting no time, but moving forward with fulfilling the Biblical model of polity. It reminds me of Paul’s own policy on his first missionary journey.</p>
<blockquote>But Jews came from Antioch and Iconium, and having persuaded the crowds, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead. But when the disciples gathered about him, he rose up and entered the city, and on the next day he went on with Barnabas to Derbe. When they had preached the gospel to that city and had made many disciples, they returned to Lystra and to Iconium and to Antioch, strengthening the souls of the disciples, encouraging them to continue in the faith, and saying that through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God. And when they had appointed elders for them in every church, with prayer and fasting they committed them to the Lord in whom they had believed. (Acts 14:19-23, ESV)</blockquote>
<p>There is so much action in this paragraph, and I think the fast-paced language as a literary technique speaks also to the fast-paced reality of the missionary journey. Paul had just planted these churches, which were made up of brand-new converts. They were what we might call “baby Christians.” And yet, he made sure there were multiple elders in each church before he moved on to the next town! When he appointed these elders, was he violating his own rule about not being hasty in the laying on of hands (1 Tim. 5:23)?</p>

      <h2><a href="/2009/05/26/the-solidarity-of-humanity/">The Solidarity of Humanity</a></h2>
      <p>At Christina’s graduation ceremony at Chico State on Saturday, a graduating senior from the College of Humanities and Fine Arts spoke about the need to remove the “filters” through which we view the mass of humanity that surrounds us. When we look at people we need to see them not as white or black, not as feminists or environmentalists, democrats or republicans, conservative or liberal. We need to see them simply as humans, just as we are, inheriting the same human condition that we do.<br /><br />Frankly, I did not expect to have a favorable reception for any of what was said on the platform that day (other than the three words “Christina Lynn Lord”!), so I was surprised when the speech actually resonated with me.<br /><br />I am currently reading Michael Horton’s <span style="font-style:italic;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/080107195X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=lbmusic&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=080107195X">Introducing Covenant Theology</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=lbmusic&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=080107195X" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" /></span>, and, Lord willing, I will be blogging through it in the coming weeks. In the first chapter, Horton condemns Western individualism, saying that covenant theology requires “our solidarity with all of creation especially our being ‘in Adam’ by virtue of the creation covenant and ‘in Christ’ in the covenant of grace” (16). He goes on to explain that “all of creation, especially all humans, stand already in a relationship to God as creator and judge in the covenant of creation. We all are bound together ethically in mutual responsibility. Each person, Christian or not, bears God’s image, and we can work side by side with non-Christians to fulfill the scriptural command to show love to our neighbors” (17). Through God’s providence, these are the same things that young lady said while the love of my life was graduating from college, and they are the same lessons we learn when we develop a worldview through the covenant framework that Scripture gives us.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width=’1’ height=’1’ src=”https://www.devlord.io/blog/2009/05/26/the-solidarity-of-humanity/”’ /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <h2><a href="/2009/05/11/do-not-destroy-the-work-of-god/">Do not destroy the work of God</a></h2>
      <p>Romans 14, ESV:<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;As for the one who is weak in faith, welcome him, but not to quarrel over opinions.  One person believes he may eat anything, while the weak person eats only vegetables.  Let not the one who eats despise the one who abstains, and let not the one who abstains pass judgment on the one who eats, for God has welcomed him.  Who are you to pass judgment on the servant of another? It is before his own master that he stands or falls. And he will be upheld, for the Lord is able to make him stand.<br /><br />One person esteems one day as better than another, while another esteems all days alike. Each one should be fully convinced in his own mind.  The one who observes the day, observes it in honor of the Lord. The one who eats, eats in honor of the Lord, since he gives thanks to God, while the one who abstains, abstains in honor of the Lord and gives thanks to God.  For none of us lives to himself, and none of us dies to himself.  For if we live, we live to the Lord, and if we die, we die to the Lord. So then, whether we live or whether we die, we are the Lord’s.  For to this end Christ died and lived again, that he might be Lord both of the dead and of the living.<br /><br />Why do you pass judgment on your brother? Or you, why do you despise your brother? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God; for it is written,<br /><br />“As I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bow to me,<br />and every tongue shall confess to God.”<br /><br />So then each of us will give an account of himself to God.<br /><br />Therefore let us not pass judgment on one another any longer, but rather decide never to put a stumbling block or hindrance in the way of a brother.  I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself, but it is unclean for anyone who thinks it unclean.  For if your brother is grieved by what you eat, you are no longer walking in love. By what you eat, do not destroy the one for whom Christ died.  So do not let what you regard as good be spoken of as evil.  For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking but of righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.  Whoever thus serves Christ is acceptable to God and approved by men.  So then let us pursue what makes for peace and for mutual upbuilding.<br /><br />Do not, for the sake of food, destroy the work of God. Everything is indeed clean, but it is wrong for anyone to make another stumble by what he eats.  It is good not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything that causes your brother to stumble.  The faith that you have, keep between yourself and God. Blessed is the one who has no reason to pass judgment on himself for what he approves.  But whoever has doubts is condemned if he eats, because the eating is not from faith. For whatever does not proceed from faith is sin.&lt;/blockquote&gt;This passage is not a proof-text for Antisabbatarianism.  Note that it does not say, “The one who does <i>not observe</i> the day, performs his <i>not-observing</i> unto the Lord and gives thanks to God.”  Such a statement is illogical, since you can’t perform something unto the Lord by not performing something unto the Lord. It is a non-action.  Paul says, in verse 5, that there are two views about observance, and each person “should be fully convinced in his own mind.”  He says that to choose the one view is to do it in honor of the Lord.  He doesn’t comment on the other view, although you may glean quite a bit from his silence.&lt;div&gt;<br />&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In verse 6, he names three things done in honor of the Lord: observing the day, eating meat, and being a vegetarian, and the Antisabbatarian view is left out intentionally, even though it is obviously not for the sake of brevity, since he goes ahead and lists all the other subjects of the discussion.  I don’t think we’re supposed to read between the lines here and assume Paul meant the Antisabbatarian honors the Lord even when he’s not honoring the Lord.  I think Paul’s point here is simply that whatever we do, whether we eat or drink, we should do it unto the Lord.  It is an active living sacrifice.  Failing to act is not an action, but is simply missing out on an opportunity to do something unto the Lord.<br /><br />But the most important theme of this chapter is that Christians are forbidden from judging Sabbatarians and vegetarians.  We are prohibited from persecuting them, from labeling their views as less-than-ideal in our Church constitutions, from calling them legalists, etc.  Such persecution is prohibited in this passage.  Each of us will give an account to God.<br /><br />You might infer from this passage that Sabbatarians are “weak in faith” (v. 1).  I do not believe that argument has a leg to stand on, however, especially since the theme of this chapter is that it is “the work of God” in the hearts of observers, and it is the work of God to build and strengthen faith, not to tear it down. Antisabbatarians do not have a biblical argument, but have taken their stance as a matter of principle. Vegetarians do not have a biblical argument, but are living in the conviction of the Holy Spirit that what is sold at the meat markets is offered to demons and therefore should be abstained from.  Meat-eaters are living in the light of Acts 10, while vegetarians see the vision as a metaphor for missions.  Sabbatarians, likewise under the conviction of God the Holy Spirit at work in their hearts, understand Scripture to be a complete whole, seek to obey the 10 Commandments, and believe that just as God made the seventh day holy in Genesis 2:3, so he made the first day holy as the providentially-scheduled resurrection of Christ.  All of these views are to be accepted as valid in the church, and are to even be commended as “the work of God” in the hearts of believers.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;<br />We are to pursue righteousness (e.g. obeying God’s commandments).  We are to pursue peace.  We are to pursue joy (v. 17).  We are to pursue mutual upbuilding (v. 19).  Even so, in verse 16, the Holy Spirit tells the victims of Antisabbatarian or dietary persecution that they are not to stand for it: “So do not let what you regard as good be spoken of as evil” (v. 16).  Christian vegetarians and Sabbatarians are convicted by the Holy Spirit that they are to be obedient to what the Holy Spirit is commanding them personally.  Therefore they have a right to seek out a church that does not condemn them, and they have a reasonable expectation, based on Rom. 14, that a biblical church would not condemn them.  Would you put anything in your Church’s constitution that would cause a vegetarian to feel like a second-class citizen?  Of course not.  Neither should you put anything in your church’s constitution that would cause a Sabbatarian to feel like a second-class citizen.  To do so is not conducive to peace and mutual upbuilding, but is to bring division and distrust and sectarianism.&lt;div&gt;<br />&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Lord is able to make us stand.<br /><br />S.D.G.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width=’1’ height=’1’ src=”https://www.devlord.io/blog/do-not-destroy-the-work-of-god/”’ /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <h2><a href="/2009/05/08/reformation-and-diversity/">Reformation and Diversity</a></h2>
      <p>To be Reformed Baptist is to affirm the 1689 London Baptist Confession.<br /><br />If you leave out parts of it, or even go so far as to declare that you believe the opposite of what it says, you’re not Reformed Baptist.  You’ve come a long way from the errors of standard modern Evangelicalism, so you are to be commended.  However, the doctrines taught in the 1689 Confession are so strongly affirmed by Reformed Baptists that if you meet someone who tells you they are Reformed Baptist, they will expect you to be on the same page about all of it.  If you go on to reveal your disagreement with a whole two paragraphs, they will be disappointed and feel like you’ve misled them.&lt;div&gt;<br />&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The 1689 LBC is based on the Westminster Confession of Faith held dear by Presbyterians and Puritans.  The majority of the content is the same, verbatim, with most of the differences being for the sake of clarification and not for the sake of disagreement (<a href="http://www.proginosko.com/docs/wcf_lbcf.html">see here</a>).  Honestly, a Presbyterian could take the 1689 Baptist Confession and leave out two paragraphs and say he affirms the rest; that’s about how much difference is between the 1689 Confession and the Westminster Standards:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;1689 LBC, Ch. 29, §2: Those who do actually profess repentance towards God, faith in, and obedience to, our Lord Jesus Christ, are the only proper subjects of this ordinance. (Mark 16:16; Acts 8:36, 37; Acts 2:41; Acts 8:12; Acts 18:8)<br /><br />Ch. 29, §4: Immersion, or dipping of the person in water, is necessary to the due administration of this ordinance. (Matthew 3:16; John 3:23)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Just take out these two paragraphs, and you have a Presbyterian!<br /><br /><a href="http://clothing.cafepress.com/item/reformed-baptist-sweatshirt/13668514" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_OZWxOfjIgdA/SgTFuR5pnNI/AAAAAAAAGj4/HJHZ8w5Bg70/s200/jitcrunch.aspx.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>But we would all agree that if a Presbyterian were to claim to be Reformed Baptist he would be exagerating at best.  I have nothing against Presbyterians–I love Scotland and the history of the Scottish Reformation, and I am thankful for the legacy of the Confession of Faith that the Westminster divines hammered out over 1,163 meetings. But I am not Presbyterian when it comes to the topic of baptism. My point is, two paragraphs can be enough to distinguish between one and the other, and both Presbyterians and Reformed Baptists would consider the difference a very important one.<br /><br />I am not of the persuasion that full subscription to the 1689 Confession should be a requirement for either leadership or membership in a Reformed church.  I do believe that churches would do well to state in their materials that they believe the Confession to be an excellent summary of what is revealed to us in Scripture, but they would do better to point people to Scripture as the ultimate authority.<br /><br />I think reformed churches should be lenient on intramural affairs.  Whenever possible, Presbyterians, Baptists, Lutherans, the Dutch, should be able to fellowship together under the same banner.  In the broader world outside the Reformed tradition, there is too much disunity over the more essential matters of salvation and the person of Christ.  Those who are Reformed have so much in common, and they are so few in number that it is absolutely suicidal to divide over matters such as baptism and the Sabbath, or the metaphysical explanations of just what Jesus meant exactly when he said, “this is my body.”  I’m not trying to start an ecumenical movement, but my prayer is that the Reformed family would find fellowship with one another and be a source of encouragement to each other rather than focusing on their differences.<br /><br /><em>Semper reformanda…</em>&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;<img width="1" height="1" src="" alt="" />&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <p>Although it is sometimes translated as “week” in the New Testament, the Greek word <em>sabbaton</em> is more often used to refer to the Sabbath day.  Of the times when it is translated, “week”, all but three of them refer to the very morning of Christ’s resurrection, where it speaks of the “first day of the week.”  Of the remaining three, two refer to the Lord’s Day, also on the “first day of the week”, in Acts 20 and 1 Cor. 16, and the remaining case is in Jesus’s parable of the Pharisee and Tax Collector in Luke 18:12, where the Pharisee boasts about fasting twice a week.  It is translated week here instead of Sabbath, because it is hard to conceive of fasting twice in one day. All other uses of the word in the New Testament are translated “Sabbath.”&lt;div&gt;<br />&lt;div&gt;Scholars say that first-century Jews counted days of the week in terms of their distance from the last Sabbath day, so, “<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style:italic;">mia ton sabbaton</span>” does mean the first day of the week, and that is how our Bibles translate it.  But this is idiomatic, as the literal rendering is “the first of the Sabbaths.”  In the gospels, when it speaks of the morning when our Lord rose from the grave, the wordplay is obvious in the Greek.  When we look at it in this light, “first of the Sabbaths” takes on a whole different meaning!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;<br />&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Crozieb, Rev. John. “Remarks on the Sabbath”, <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style:italic;">The Reformed Presbyterian and Covenanter</span>, vol XI, 1873. pp. 82, 83. <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=FPEZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA83&amp;lpg=PA83&amp;dq=mia+ton+sabbaton&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-p92EavM_j&amp;sig=4zZcorSdwBJ_v2fkS6wbVUQVWf0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=eYcCSpaoEqjytQOv9Z3EBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1">Google Books</a>.&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;But the perfectly harmonious testimony of Paul, and the four inspired Evangelists, as it reads in the Greek, is clear and positive proof that the day was changed at the time Christ rose from the dead. In Matt. 28 : 1, the inspired words are: In the end (or closing), “<i>opse </i><i>Sabbaton</i><i>”</i>—:of the Sabbaths (plural)—as it began to dawn (shine into), “<i>eis mian </i><i>Sabbaton,” </i>one of the Sabbaths, came they to see the sepulchre. Here the Spirit of God puts forty-eight hours—two whole days of Sabbath time together. The first day of twenty-four hours legally and practically terminated the Old Testament seventh-day Sabbaths, upon the last one of which the Saviour’s body lay lifeless in the tomb. The second day of twenty-four hours which immediately followed, legally and practically commenced—not the heathen or idolatrous Sunday, as the <i>heathen </i>call it, upon which the sun in the firmament was worshipped—but was “<i>mia Sabbaton,” </i>(the first), one of the Sabbaths which Christ brought with him from the tomb, where he left the seventh day dead and buried forever. The testimony of Mark, Luke and John is precisely the same. Mark says, 16:1, 2, “ And when ‘<i>ton </i><i>Sabbatou,’</i>—the Sabbath (upon which he lay in the tomb) was <i>past, </i>very early in the morning, ‘<i>mia Sabbaton,’ </i>the first one of the Sabbaths, at the rising of the sun, they came to the sepulchre ;” and verse 9th, “Jesus early, ‘<i>prota </i><i>Sabbaton,’ </i><i>the first Sabbath, </i>appeared first to Mary Magdalene.” Luke says, 24:1, “Upon <i>‘mia ton </i><i>Sabbaton </i>(the first one), of the Sabbaths—very early in the morning they came.” John says, 20 : 1, “<i>Mia ton Sabbaton</i><i>”</i>—the first one of the Sabbaths—”early, while it was yet dark, they came;” and to show that Christ kept Sabbath that <i>whole day, </i>he says, v. 19, “The same day at evening, being ‘<i>mia ton Sabbaton </i>(the first), one of the Sabbaths, he was in the midst of the disciples.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Matthew 28:1 can be rendered literally as, “at the end of the Sabbaths, as it began to dawn towards the first of the Sabbaths.”  Reformed and covenant theology types have understood this figure of speech to be of profound significance, pointing to the deep truth that God was bringing an end to the seventh day observance and sanctifying the first day as the new Christian Sabbath.  I do not believe this conclusion is based on a too-literal reading of the Greek, because, even without this figure of speech, they would have come to the same conclusion–the first day of the week was consecrated like no other day has ever been consecrated, when God blessed it with the most significant event that ever was–and also with the further Scripture proofs of Christians worshiping on Sunday.  But you can’t help but appreciate the significance of the wording that the Holy Spirit, through the gospel writers, employed in signifying the first Lord’s Day.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <p>Joshua 24:15 is often used as a memory verse, ommitting about half of it: “Choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve…. As for me and my household, we will serve the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span>” (NIV, abridged).  I can think of Family Camp on Catalina where that was the memory verse for the week.  It really sounds like a nice Arminian proof text, doesn’t it?  Makes you want to stand up and say, “I’m on the Lord’s side! Yay for me! I made the right choice!”</p>

      <h2><a href="/2009/05/06/the-creation-ordinances/">The Creation Ordinances</a></h2>
      <p>The three Creation Ordinances are<br />&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Marriage - Healthy families and honoring God.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dominion - Knowing and following our vocation in life.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sabbath - If we will honor God with our labor, we must also show our submission to his Lordship by resting from our labors when he tells us to do so. (<a href="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/3150/christianworldandlifeview.html?20094#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Stark</a>)<br />&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;Here is an example of the Creation Ordinance hermeneutic applied by the Apostle Paul: “I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man; rather, she is to remain quiet. For Adam was formed first, then Eve; and Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor. Yet she will be saved through childbearing—if they continue in faith and love and holiness, with self-control.” 1 Tim 2:12-15 (ESV)<br /><br />Liberal theologians will reject this passage and allow for women pastors. But theological conservatives such as the Reformed take this literally and do not allow women to be elders or pastors. But do they do this only because Paul said it? Or can they look at the creation principle behind Paul, learn from his hermeneutic, and apply Genesis 1-3 to the modern world just as he did? You see, if we had a proper hermeneutic, then if these three verses were left out of the Bible, we should have been able to come to the same conclusion.<u><br /><br /></u>R. C. Sproul’s <a href="http://www.cbmw.org/Resources/Articles/The-Order-of-Creation#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a> on the Council for Biblical Manhood and Womanhood website:<br />&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The question of whether the subordination of wives to husbands in marriage and of women to men in the church is merely a cultural custom of the ancient world is a burning one. If indeed these matters were articulated as cultural customs and not binding principles, it would be a serious miscarriage of justice to apply them transculturally to societies where they don’t belong. On the other hand, if they were given as trans-cultural principles by divine mandate, to treat them as mere cultural conventions would be to do violence to the Holy Spirit and to rebel against God Himself…<br /><br />One of the chief considerations in determining the question of principle or custom is whether the matter involves a Creation ordinance. Creation ordinances may be distinguished both from old covenant laws and new covenant commands. The first consideration concerns the parties to the various covenants…who are the parties to the covenant of Creation? In Creation, God makes a covenant not simply with Jews or with Christians, but with man <em>qua</em> man. As long as humans exist in a covenant relationship with the Creator, the laws of Creation remain intact. They are reaffirmed in both the old covenant and the new covenant.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Here’s an illustration for all you <i>Battlestar Galactica</i> fans out there. Say we were to invent some Cylons and they were to take over our planet and the surviving humans were to get on spaceships and take off to find an inhabitable planet far, far away… The Creation Ordinances of Marriage, Labor, and Sabbath would still apply, because the parties to the original covenant: Man, and God, would still exist.<u><br /></u>&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <div><div><a href="http://www.reformedtheology.ca/mark2b.htm">Here</a> is a very good sermon manuscript by Bryn MacPhail on a Canadian reformed theology website entitled "Should Christians Keep the Sabbath?"  This pretty accurately summarizes our family's Confessional view on the Lord's Day, including the "duties of necessity" portion, which is implied by the heads of grain in Mark 2 as well as Luke 14: "Which of you, having a son or an ox that has fallen into a well on a Sabbath day, will not immediately pull him out?" (ESV).<br /></div></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>This is core to the exegetical task: When God said something in the Old Testament, we look at what he said about it in the New Testament.  We try to interpret Scripture with Scripture to come to a better understanding of the whole counsel of God.  For example, in coming to Scripture in this way, we can see that it is okay to eat pork because of Peter's vision in Acts 10.  We must do the same with the fourth commandment and come to it the way Jesus explained it, and not the way the Pharisees explained it.<br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>"whoever relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven..." (see Mt. 5:17-19, ESV)<br /></div>

Since it  was a replacement phone it did not come with a full-length warranty,  so I was on my own. I ordered a new button on eBay and last night set  about disassembling my iPhone in an attempt to replace it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FAIL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After many hours, I had broken it even worse than it was before,  accidentally tearing the ribbon cable connecting the button assembly  to the motherboard. And I spent a long time trying to reassemble the  thing because it’s much harder to place tiny screws in their holes and  screw them in than it is to unscrew them and remove them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason I wanted to blog about this, however, was to celebrate the  love my gracious gorgeous wife bestowed on my be letting me tinker with my old phone for the better part of the evening.

In the early 1900s you might have heard “The Old Rugged Cross,” a celebration of the atonement.

But if he wants to talk ethics, what about Psalm 101:3a (ESV), which says, “I will not set before my eyes anything that is worthless,” and the countless other passages in which we are told to be on guard about what we look at.<br /><br />If a business fails because people refuse to set their worthless adverts before their eyes, then they need to change their business plan.  And when it comes to blogs, people who are in it for the money aren’t the ones whose blogs are worth reading.  Especially “Christian” blogs.  ”Den of thieves…“<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style:italic;">Plug: <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1865">Adblock</a> is really good for blocking the inappropriate ads which are prevalent on sites like MySpace.  </span>I’ve recommended it before<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style:italic;">.</span></p>

      <p>From Al Mohler:&lt;blockquote&gt;But the most basic problem with Barbie is the fact that she lies.  Constantly.  The entire Barbie package presents one huge lie about the nature of true beauty.  According to the Christian worldview, beauty and truth and goodness are identical.  A lie cannot be beautiful and the truth is never ugly.  Barbie’s total presentation represents a lie about feminine beauty, suggesting in not-too-subtle ways that external attractiveness (even artificial attractiveness) is the foundation of true beauty.<br /><br />But, according to the biblical worldview, genuine beauty is found within – in the being and character of a person – not in their external appearance.  The first principle of human beauty is the fact that every human being, male and female, is made in God’s image.  No one made in God’s image can be anything less than beautiful.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Read more.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <p>From computer scientist <a href="http://programforthefuture.org/speakers/alan-kay">Alan Kay</a>, at the Program for the Future conference:<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;The most disgusting thing I’ve seen recently in the form of trivia is a new controller for <i>Guitar Hero</i> which looks just like a Fender Strat/Stratocaster guitar and it costs 180 bucks, and it’s not a guitar.  I can tell you, you can go to a guitar store and you can get an awfully playable guitar for 180 bucks.  The idea that they’re selling this piece of crap so that people can pretend to do something that they haven’t been willing to sit down and learn how to do is just disgusting.  But I believe it is the ill of our age, that people are–  In the Bible, Esau sold his birthright for a cup of soup [“mess of pottage”, a co-panelist interjects].  I believe that’s basically what (especially Americans) are doing, is selling our potential for simple little cups of pottage over and over again.&lt;/blockquote&gt;This is an awesome quote.  If I ever become a preacher, I’m going to use it.  For now, I’ll just blog about it.<br /><br />I was IM-ing with a newbie at work who was a music composition major.  Though he was also a cellist, he just kept talking about sequencing, and I could tell that was his passion.  As an acoustic instrumentalist, I think it’s sad.  It would be better to use computers to compose music that could be played with real acoustic instruments offline.  Or to learn how to play better (e.g. GarageBand has a built-in tuner that you can use to monitor your intonation).  I think computers should help us become better at being humans when we’re disconnected.  If we were going to have a power crisis or if we were hit with some electromagnetic pulse bomb that disabled our electronics, would what we have done on the computer have enriched our lives and equipped us for life <i>sans ordinateur</i>?  Would those hours playing WOW equip you with the skills necessary to build faction reputation with those you meet IRL?  Would the emoticons and “LOLs” you use in IM-ing equip you for real human interaction?  Or would you be totally paralyzed?&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</p>

Of course, in my unregenerate state, I had almost no understanding whatsoever of the love of Christ for me. I knew that He loved me and I was <em>supposed</em> to love Him, because we sang about it and all. But loving Him just because He loved me first didn’t seem like a particularly noble or admirable reason for loving Him.

      <p><a href="https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/the-president-the-passengers-and-the-patience-of-god">John Piper</a> uses Matthew 10:29 and Daniel 2:21 to <a href="https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/the-president-the-passengers-and-the-patience-of-god">reflect</a> on how the wondrous works God is performing in our land were ordained to demonstrate his mercy and longsuffering.  Here’s an excerpt:&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;If God guides geese so precisely, he also guides the captain’s hands. God knew that when he took the plane down, he would also give a spectacular deliverance. So why would he do that? If he means for all to live, why not just skip the crash?<br /><br />Because he meant to give our nation a parable of his power and mercy the week before a new President takes office. God can take down a plane any time he pleases—and if he does, he wrongs no one. Apart from Christ, none of us deserves anything from God but judgment. We have belittled him so consistently that he would be perfectly just to take any of us any time in any way he chooses.<br /><br />But God is longsuffering. He is slow to anger. He withholds wrath every day. This is what we saw in the parable. The crash of Flight 1549 illustrates God’s right and power to judge. The landing of the plane represents God’s mercy. It was God’s call to all the passengers and all their families and all who heard the story to repent and turn to God’s Son, Jesus Christ, and receive forgiveness for sin.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I strongly encourage you to <a href="https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/the-president-the-passengers-and-the-patience-of-god">read this article</a> and pass it along.<br />&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I promised last month to post some articles on the Order of Elective Decrees, and here's the final entry, dealing with the topics of Amyraldism and Improved Amyraldism, or Baxterianism. The doctrine of Amyraldism, was formulated by Moise Amyraut, a French theologian who taught at the University of Saumur. A version of it was also held to by English Puritan Richard Baxter, who actually developed the theological framework separately from Amyraut, before he had ever read any of his works (see Timothy Beougher, <a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1845503104?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=lbmusic&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1845503104">Richard Baxter and Conversion: A Study of Puritan Concept of Becoming Christian</a>).</p>

      <h2><a href="/2009/01/03/we-have-gone-back-to-the-old-school/">&quot;We have gone back to the old school&#8230;&quot;</a></h2>
      <blockquote>It is often said that the doctrines we believe have a tendency to lead us to sin. I have heard it asserted most positively, that those high doctrines which we love, and which we find in the Scriptures, are licentious ones. I do not know who will have the hardihood to make that assertion, when they consider that the holiest of men have been believers in them. I ask the man who dares to say that Calvinism is a licentious religion, what he thinks of the character of Augustine, or Calvin, or Whitefield, who in successive ages were the great exponents of the system of grace; or what will he say of the Puritans, whose works are full of them? Had a man been an Arminian in those days, he would have been accounted the vilest heretic breathing; but now we are looked upon as the heretics, and they as the orthodox. We have gone back to the old school; we can trace our descent from the apostles. It is that vein of free-grace, running through the sermonizing of Baptists, which has saved us as a denomination. Were it not for that, we should not stand where we are to-day. We can run a golden line up to Jesus Christ Himself, through a holy succession of mighty fathers, who all held these glorious truths; and we can ask concerning them, "Where will you find holier and better men in the world?" No doctrine is so calculated to preserve a man from sin as the doctrine of the grace of God. Those who have called it "a licentious doctrine" did not know anything at all about it. Poor ignorant things, they little knew that their own vile stuff was the most licentious doctrine under Heaven. If they knew the grace of God in truth, they would soon see that there was no preservative from lying like a knowledge that we are elect of God from the foundation of the world. There is nothing like a belief in my eternal perseverance, and the immutability of my Father's affection, which can keep me near to Him from a motive of simple gratitude. Nothing makes a man so virtuous as belief of the truth. A lying doctrine will soon beget a lying practice. A man cannot have an erroneous belief without by-and-by having an erroneous life. I believe the one thing naturally begets the other. Of all men, those have the most disinterested piety, the sublimest reverence, the most ardent devotion, who believe that they are saved by grace, without works, through faith, and that not of themselves, it is the gift of God. Christians should take heed, and see that it always is so, lest by any means Christ should be crucified afresh, and put to an open shame.</blockquote>

      <p>As promised, here is another post on the Order of Decrees.<br /><br />There are several different opinions regarding the meaning of the terms Sublapsarian and Infralapsarian.  Some people use one to refer to the traditional reformed Infralapsarian view, and the other to refer to Amyraldism (which I will explain in a later post).  But there is usually no distinction between the Infralapsarian and Sublapsarian views; they are considered synonyms.<br /><br />The Latin <span style="font-style:italic;">infra-</span> means below and the Latin <span style="font-style:italic;">sub-</span> means under (as in directly).  Technically, if you wanted, you could differentiate between the two by placing election directly after the fall in one order, but anywhere after the fall in the other (such is inserting the provision of salvation in between).  This is the way Lewis Sperry Chafer uses the terms.<br /><br />The founder of Dispensationalism, Lewis Sperry Chafer (who was a Presbyterian, although the renowned theologian B.B. Warfield has criticized him as having been influenced by the perfectionist Keswick doctrince, a.k.a “Higher Life”), makes a distinction between the two in his <span style="font-style:italic;">Systematic Theology</span>.<br /><br />He reports the Supralapsarian view as the following order:<br />&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Decree to elect some to be saved and to reprobate all others.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Decree to create men both elect and nonelect.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Decree to permit the fall.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Decree to provide salvation for the elect.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Decree to apply salvation to the elect.  (Chafer, <span style="font-style:italic;">Systematic Theology</span>, 179)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;According to Chafer, Infralapsarian differs from Supralapsarian because the decrees of election and retribution follow the fall:<br />&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Decree to create all men.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Decree to permit the fall.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Decree to provide salvation for men.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Decree to elect those who do believe and to leave in just condemnation all who do not believe.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Decree to apply salvation to those who believe.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;It should be noted that the Chafer does not make the distinction he should as to on what it means to “provide salvation for men”, since it should say “provide salvation for the elect,” in order to make a fair comparison.  I think he is unaware of the controversy between Universal Atonement and Particular Redemption.  If he truly means “provide salvation for <span style="font-style:italic;">all</span> men”, then Chafer’s Infralapsarian is actually Amyraldian.<br /><br />Chafer’s Sublapsarian order more closely resembles the traditional Reformed Infralapsarian view, except he is again uses the ambiguous phrase, “provide salvation for men”:<br />&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Decree to create all men.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Decree to permit the fall.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Decree to elect those who do believe and to leave in just condemnation those who do not believe.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Decree to provide salvation for men.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Decree to apply salvation to those who believe.  (Chafer, 181)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;While the distinctions between the Reformed Infralapsarian order and the Supralapsarian order concern the state of man while God is pondering election, so the difference between Sublapsarian and Infralapsarian views in Chafer’s imagination seem to emphasize Christ as the means of salvation.  The Sublapsarian view puts election as superlative to Christ’s atonement.  But Chafer’s Infralapsarian view stresses that it is “in Christ” that we are elect (if he means that salvation is provided for the elect).  In the same way that we cannot think of God contemplating the reprobation of men without contemplating them as fallen, we also cannot think of God contemplating the elect without contemplating them as having a means of atonement.  But really they go together.  You cannot have one without the other, and this is what the Five Points of Calvinism teach us: Christ died for the elect, in order to redeem them, and they cannot be redeemed apart from Christ’s particular atonement.  God has provided for himself the Lamb (Genesis 22:8).  Since Five-Point Calvinists consider election and the atonement as going hand-in-hand, the distinction between Infralapsarian and Sublapsarian is usually not made.  The order is a logical order, in the mind of God, and not a chronological order, and the arguments are theoretical.<br /><br />Some others seem to identify Sublapsarianism with Amyraldism, and others take offense and say this is incorrect.  In Chafer’s scheme, <span style="font-style:italic;">Infralapsarianism</span> is very close to Amyraldism, but anyone who is going to take a stand against Amyraldism is going to use classify himself as an Infralapsarian.  To avoid confusion, we should probably deny Chafer’s categories and consider Infralapsarianism and Amyraldism in their separate respects (as we will do in a later post).<br /><br />We are elect <span style="font-style:italic;">in Christ</span>.  We believe that Christ died <span style="font-style:italic;">for the elect</span>.  We do not believe that we were chosen without regard to the atonement of Christ.  But we also believe in the Limited Atonement, or Particular Redemption—that it was Christ dying for us, the elect.  If the decree of Christ as the means of providing salvation is placed prior to the decree of election, it does not harm us, because his eternal purposes in redemption were<span style="font-style:italic;"> aimed</span> at his elect: he had us clearly in his sights.<br /><br />We had an interesting discussion several months ago as part of our home fellowship series on our church’s Affirmation of Faith, when we were discussing the different views on the Lord’s Supper.  Calvin believed Jesus was really present, though not in the elements either trans-substantially or con-substatiatially.  So it is right and proper to think of Christ’s presence when you take communion.  In the same way, as an act of worship, it is proper for us to visualize Christ on the cross as literally thinking of each and every one of his sheep, as the ones he died for, and each and every one of our sins, as the sins he was covering.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width=’1’ height=’1’ src=”https://www.devlord.io/blog/2008/12/13/the-order-of-gods-eternal-elective-decrees-part-2/”’ /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <p>This was posted today on <a href="http://www.challies.com/archives/articles/awakening-to-grace.php">Challies.com</a>:<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;We look back at the disciples, and we wonder, “What in the world was wrong with them? How could they not get it?” The reality is quite the opposite. We should ask instead, “How <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style:italic;">could</span> they get it?” It is impossible. It is beyond comprehension. The Old Covenant sacrifices, as powerful a pointer as they were, had a limited purpose. Their purpose was simply to show us how even the most rational and beautiful picture of grace–a blood sacrifice for sin–falls flat in front of what Jesus actually did.<br /><br />Jesus trained men who, because of their background, should have been ready for the great blood sacrifice of Jesus on the cross. They weren’t. They were still utterly incapable of “getting it” just from the facts. This is understandable. The ultimate fact is that it is absolutely impossible to come to an understanding of God’s grace just from an assessment of the facts.  (from Richard Ganz, <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style:italic;"><a>Take Charge of Your Life</a>)</span>&lt;/blockquote&gt;Next time you find your self saying, “Peter, how could you be such a bonehead?”– remember, “<a href="http://www.graceandtruth.org.uk/Articles/john_bradfordpf.htm">There but for the grace of God go I</a>.”&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <p>I’ve been meaning to post on this for a while. Mark Driscoll <a href="http://www.marshillchurch.org/audio/driscoll_sebts_092107.mp3">spoke about the Emergent church</a> at Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary in 2007. It’s a very good message that describes the history of the Emergent church, his involvement with the Emergent movement and subsequent separation, and the movement’s dangerous doctrines. The message brings a lot more insight into the issue than any other sources I’ve seen. The tone is very serious, and I actually think it’s on the level of the D.A. Carson <a href="http://www.monergism.com/directory/link_category/Audio-and-Multimedia/All-Speakers-Lectures-and-Sermons/DA-Carson/Emergent-Church/">series</a> that’s available on Mongergism. It is a departure from his usual joviality, and it marks a new shift in Driscoll’s stance, in my opinion.</p>

<blockquote>The two parties here are known in the history of thought by the contrasting names of Supralapsarians and Sublapsarians or Infralapsarians. The point of difference between them is whether God, in his dealing with men with reference to their destiny, divides them into two classes merely as men, or as sinners. That is to say, whether God's decree of election and preterition concerns men contemplated merely as men, or contemplated as already sinful men, a massa corrupta.

      <p>Tim Challies recently <a href="http://www.blogger.com/post-create.g?blogID=2602771351651662379">posted an excerpt</a> from Sinclair Ferguson’s book <a><i>In Christ Alone</i></a> on the Ligonier Ministries blog.  It is rather awesome and I highly recommend that you <a href="http://www.blogger.com/post-create.g?blogID=2602771351651662379">read it</a>.<br /><br />I identified with the story he told of taking his son shopping and disturbing all the patrons when his young son pointed and asked, “Daddy, who is that <i>funny-looking</i> man?”  I wonder if my dad has similar stories to tell.&lt;div&gt;<br />&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Ferguson’s article illustrates that people have taken the attributes of Santa Claus and tried to apply them to Christ:<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;…we may denigrate our Lord with a Santa Claus Christology. How sadly common it is for the church to manufacture a Jesus who is a mirror refection of Santa Claus. He becomes Santa Christ.<br /><br />Santa Christ is sometimes a Pelagian Jesus. Like Santa, he simply asks us whether we have been good. More exactly, since the assumption is that we are all naturally good, Santa Christ asks us whether we have been “good enough.” So just as Christmas dinner is simply the better dinner we really deserve, Jesus becomes a kind of added bonus who makes a good life even better. He is not seen as the Savior of helpless sinners…<br /><br />Then again, Santa Christ may be a mystical Jesus, who, like Santa Claus, is important because of the good experiences we have when we think about him, irrespective of his historical reality. It doesn’t really matter whether the story is true or not; the important thing is the spirit of Santa Christ. For that matter, while it would spoil things to tell the children this, everyone can make up his or her own Santa Christ. As long as we have the right spirit of Santa Christ, all is well.&lt;/blockquote&gt;One thing that particularly struck me was the fact that early Christians were actually killed for their radically counter-culture commemoration of Christ’s birth.<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;In fact, such was the malice evoked by their other-worldly devotion to Christ that during the persecutions under the Emperor Diocletian, some believers were murdered as they gathered to celebrate Christmas. What was their gross offense? Worship of the true Christ – incarnate, crucified, risen, glorified, and returning. They celebrated Him that day for giving His all for them, and as they did so, they gave their all for Him.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Is your celebration of Christmas counter-cultural?  What steps do you take to make sure that Christmas is Christ-centered in your family?<br />&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <p>For a special Thanksgiving treat, we’re going to ponder a significant passage by Jonathan Edwards, from a book called <span style="font-style:italic;">Miscellaneous Observations on Important Theological Subjects. Original and Collected, </span>ch. III, “Concerning the Divine Decrees, &amp;c.” (<span style="font-style:italic;">Works</span> Banner of Truth edition, vol. 2, p. 528,):</p>
<blockquote>§ 10. It is a proper and excellent thing for infinite glory to shine forth; and for the same reason, it is proper that the shining forth of God's glory should be complete; that is, that all parts of his glory should shine forth, that every beauty should be proportionably effulgent, that the beholder may have a proper notion of God. It is not proper that one glory should be exceedingly manifested, and another not at all; for then the effulgence would not answer the reality. For the same reason it is not proper that one should be manifested exceedingly, and another but very little. It is highly proper that the effulgent glory of God should answer his real excellency; that the splendour should be answerable to the real and essential glory, for the same reason that it is proper and excellent for God to glorify himself at all. Thus it is necessary, that God's awful majesty, his authority and dreadful greatness, justice, and holiness, should be manifested. But this could not be, unless sin and punishment had been decreed; so that the shining forth of God's glory would be very imperfect, both because these parts of divine glory would not shine forth as the others do, and also the glory of his goodness, love, and holiness would be faint without them; nay, they could scarcely shine forth at all. If it were not right that God should decree and permit and punish sin, there could be no manifestation of God's holiness in hatred of sin, or in showing any preference, in his providence, of godliness before it. There would be no manifestation of God's grace or true goodness, if there was no sin to be pardoned, no misery to be saved from. How much happiness soever he bestowed, his goodness would not be so much prized and admired, and the sense of it not so great, as we have elsewhere shown. We little consider how much the sense of good is heightened by the sense of evil, both moral and natural. And as it is necessary that there should be evil, because the display of the glory of God could not but be imperfect and incomplete without it, so evil is necessary, in order to the highest happiness of the creature, and the completeness of that communication of God, for which he made the world; because the creature's happiness consists in the knowledge of God, and sense of his love. And if the knowledge of him be imperfect, the happiness of the creature must be proportionably imperfect; and the happiness of the creature would be imperfect upon another account also; for, as we have said, the sense of good is comparatively dull and flat, without the knowledge of evil.</blockquote>

(And by “jerks” I mean it in the network-TV-censorsed <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088763/quotes">Marty McFly</a> sense—”What happens to us in the future, do we all become <i>jerks</i> or something?”)<br /><br /><a href="http://www.usmint.gov/images/mint_programs/$1coin/picEdgeLettering_stack.jpg"><img src="http://www.usmint.gov/images/mint_programs/$1coin/picEdgeLettering_stack.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>The funny thing is, IN GOD WE TRUST is on the coins, but it’s placing cleverly on the outside edge, following the model of the British 2-pound coins.<br /><br />I actually listened to a Q &amp; A session from John MacArthur at the Shepherds Conference in which someone asked him a question about politics and he said something along the lines of, which singular person has the job of president of the United States for 4 or 8 years matters very little in the scheme of things.  He laughed it off and moved on to the next question (in this same session he spent like 15 minutes talking about his pens).  <a href="http://www.sfpulpit.com/2008/10/19/politics-activism-and-the-gospel/">This article</a> is about how much more important the cause of Christ is than one temporal election season.  I encourage you to read it.&lt;blockquote&gt;When the church takes a stance that emphasizes political activism and social moralizing, it always diverts energy and resources away from evangelization. Such an antagonistic position toward the established secular culture invariably leads believers to feel hostile not only to unsaved government leaders with whom they disagree, but also antagonistic toward the unsaved residents of that culture—neighbors and fellow citizens they ought to love, pray for, and share the gospel with. To me it is unthinkable that we become enemies of the very people we seek to win to Christ, our potential brothers and sisters in the Lord.&lt;/blockquote&gt;And this, from musician <a href="http://www.shaungroves.com/shlog/comments/help_the_church_vote_for_a_madman/">Shaun Groves</a>:<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;I understand wanting to vote for someone under whom Christianity would flourish.  I get that.  Let me think about who that might be for a second.  OK, well, because of what history teaches us about the conditions under which Christianity thrives you might want to vote for a guy or girl who will lock up our churches, strip us of our freedoms, imprison us for praying, and is a bit of a psychotic pyromaniac [like Nero].  That’s the kind of guy whose intolerance and brutality helped turn a Jewish cult into a major world religion.<br /><br />God and His Church have never needed a president’s or Caesar’s support in order to survive.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <p>This morning, John Piper published an excellent <a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/ResourceLibrary/TasteAndSee/ByDate/2008/3347_Let_Christians_Vote_As_Though_They_Were_Not_Voting/">Taste and See</a> article at <a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/">Desiring God</a> entitled, “Let Christians Vote As Though They Were Not Voting”.  It is based on Paul’s exhortations in <a href="http://www.gnpcb.org/esv/search/?go=Go&amp;q=1+Corinthians+7:29-31">1 Cor. 7:29-31</a> (ESV), to “deal with the world as though [we] had no dealings with it.”  Each of the areas Paul addresses, Piper takes and applies to voting.  It’s a remarkable specimen of exposition and application.&lt;blockquote&gt;<em>So it is with voting.</em> There are joys. The very act of voting is a joyful statement that we are not under a tyrant. And there may be happy victories. But the best government we get is a foreshadowing. Peace and justice are approximated now. They will be perfect when Christ comes. So our joy is modest. Our triumphs are short-lived—and shot through with imperfection. So we vote as though not voting.&lt;/blockquote&gt;<a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/ResourceLibrary/TasteAndSee/ByDate/2008/3347_Let_Christians_Vote_As_Though_They_Were_Not_Voting/">Read the full article</a>.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <p>Donald Miller, author of <em><a>Blue Like Jazz</a></em>, is one of the leaders in the emergent church. I used to like his writing because it offered sort of a contemporary edge and made Christians feel like it’s okay to listen to secular music and get inspired by cool movies. Honestly, I don’t think he’s as harmful as some others, like Rob Bell, because he’s not a pastor, just an author. But, by falling in line with some others in the emergent church, he has thereby identified himself with watered-down theology.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2008/10/02/calendar-synchronization/">Calendar Synchronization</a></h2>
      <p>Today I came across a service called <a href="http://www.nuevasync.com/">NuevaSync</a>.  It allows you to sync calendars between Google Calendar, Gmail, Plaxo (which I don’t use actively, was just automatically signed up for from AIM a couple years ago), and mobile devices that support Exchange, like the iPhone and Windows Mobile-based devices.  I thought about this after reading a little bit about the <a href="http://networkcultures.org/wpmu/geert/2008/09/25/interview-with-scott-rosenberg-about-dreaming-in-code/">Chandler Project</a>, an open-sourced project intended to compete with Microsoft Outlook.  Scott Rosenberg worked on the project for three years and left before its first release, and has said, “For now, Google Calendar does the job for me.”  I use Outlook at work, but not the Calendaring feature.  I used to use iCal on my MacBook, which sync’ed nicely, but since my hard drive crashed and had to be replaced, I am back to using my PC as my primary machine, and my MacBook only when necessary.  The only way Google Calendar would be useful to me would be if it synced with my iPhone.<br /><br />Which it does, now, with NuevaSync.<br /><br />Setup is a <a href="http://aolsvc.merriam-webster.aol.com/dictionary/cinch">cinch</a>.<br /><br />Step 1: Click on the “sign up” link and enter your user info.<br />Step 2: Check your e-mail and click on the link.<br />Step 3: Sign in and set up your services.<br />Step 4: Configure your phone.<br /><br />It’s a mobile-friendly site, so you don’t need to be on your computer to set this all up.<br /><br />When you set up your Google Calendar service, it will take you to an official Google site where you confirm your access request.  It appears this is all done through an API rather than screen scraping, so you don’t have to worry about NuevaSync having access to your password or any other information from your GMail account.<br /><br /><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/clip_image0021.jpg"><img src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/clip_image0021.jpg?w=300" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />Unfortunately, I cannot go any further in this review as far as how well it works or how convenient it is.  It turns out Apple syncs from a clean slate, so you will lose all your existing contacts and calendar information if you choose to use this service.  I’m not willing to do this, but as iPhone updates come out in the future, I’ll keep checking back on <a href="https://www.nuevasync.com/apple_info.html">this page</a> to see if anything has changed.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <p>Michael McKinley over at <a href="http://blog.9marks.org/2008/09/does-your-churc.html">9Marks</a> posted about a glossy mailer he received announcing a new church in his area which intends to draw crowds not only with a secular-sounding rock band–that would be one thing, and from my background, I wouldn’t be so offended by that, but promoting it as a reason for people to come to your church?  Come on!  What makes this even worse, they’re covering the hits as well…&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Does your church music suck?<br /><br />We’re with you. That’s why we started _____, a new church where our music sounds more like what you have one your iPod or listen to in your car. Every week we also cover some of your favorite Guitar Hero and Rock Band classics, along with current songs by bands like: Coldplay, All-American Rejects, Daughtry and others.<br /><br />Yes, we actually play those songs. And no, we don’t “Jesus-up” the lyrics.&lt;/blockquote&gt;It just goes from bad to worse, exactly like in 2 Kings 17:7-23.  In verse 8 (ESV) it says that Israel “walked in the customs of the nations whom the LORD drove out before the people of Israel” (think postmodernism and syncretism in the church), and by verse 17 they’re killing their sons and daughters on the altars of their idolatry (think abortion), until finally, the Lord “cast them out of his sight.”&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;<br />&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Pray for the elect in this country, that they will not be led astray (if possible) by the wolves in sheep’s clothing (Mark 13:22).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <p>“It’s Rising Up” is one of those songs in the key of E Major, with the great open chord shapes guitar players love. It also has a great chorus, with “Holy is the Lord” repeated over and over again. Unfortunately, the rest of the song lacks depth.<br /><br />One Friday night in July I had put this song on my song list for Sunday and sent it off to the sister who puts the bulletins together, but at 6 in the morning on Saturday the Lord woke me up and convicted me about it, and I switched the song out for another song written by the same cowriter.<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;And we have heard the lion’s roar<br />That speaks of heaven’s love and power<br />Is this the time, is this the call<br />That ushers in your Kingdom rule?<br /><br />– Martin Smith, Matt Redman, “It’s Rising Up”, © 1995 Thankyou Music&lt;/blockquote&gt;What does this mean? Is it scriptural? Is it some reference to Narnia’s Aslan? Or is it one if the animal noises from the “holy laughter” phenomenon? This is only speculation, but it may have been inspired by a “prophetic” teaching from Hosea 11 or Revelation 10, where the voice of a lion is most closely associated with the coming of the kingdom of God.  (Hosea 11 is, in fact, one of the several scripture passages listed as the source for this song in CCLI’s song directory.)&lt;div&gt;<br />&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;By “prophetic” teaching, I mean the types of “sermons” preached by many which do not consider context or intended readers, or author’s intent when “expositing” scripture, but instead use scattered verses as prophetic words to the modern audience.  If this is the case, the inferences the song makes about these passages is very speculative.  If the song was a response to a message at a certain church or conference, it may be that the song had meaning to its original audience. However, the universal church today would not be able to make this association.  Americans and Australians singing this song on a Sunday morning would be hearing these words in a very different context from the actual youth group or youth conference where the song premiered.  In any case, the vagueness of this verse makes it unsuitable for corporate worship.<br />&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;<br />In contrast, I think of the little-known passage in 1 Samuel which corresponds to the obscure “Ebenezer” reference in the great classic hymn “Come, Thou Fount of Every Blessing”:  “Then Samuel took a stone and set it up between Mizpah and Shen  and called its name Ebenezer; for he said, ‘Till now the Lord has helped us’” (1 Sam. 7:12, ESV).&lt;div&gt;<br />How does this compare to the “prophetic” application of random scripture passages?  It is quite different, because the interpretation is not speculative: the application is universal, as long as the congregation singing the song is widely-versed in scripture and expository preaching.  (Of course, this means that your average church that picks songs based on the latest David Crowder hits might not have the scriptural knowledge necessary to make this connection.)<br /><br />The song which I was convicted to do in place of “It’s Rising Up” was “Blessed Be Your Name”, by Matt and Beth Redman.<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;Blessed be your name<br />When the sun’s shining down on me<br />When the world’s all as it should be<br />Blessed be your name<br /><br />Blessed be your name<br />On the road marked with suffering<br />Though there’s pain in the offering<br />Blessed be your name<br /><br />Every blessing you pour out,<br />I’ll turn back to praise<br />When the darkness closes in, Lord<br />Still I will say…<br />Blessed be the name of the Lord<br /><br />You give and take away…<br /><br />– Beth Redman, Matt Redman, “Blessed Be Your Name”, © 2005 Thankyou Music<br />&lt;/blockquote&gt;These words were penned by the same hand.  See how far Matt Redman had come in seven years!  See how saturated the song is with the sovereignty of God!<br /><br />“You give and take away…”  The scriptural application of the book of Job is, in fact, universal for all believers.  James 5:11 (ESV) says, “<span class="verse-num" id="v59005011-1"></span>Behold, we consider those blessed who remained steadfast. You have heard of the steadfastness of Job, and you have seen the purpose of the Lord, how the Lord is compassionate and merciful.”  Note how James does not blame Job’s suffering on the devil.  Rather, he makes Job an example to us of a true believer submitted to the will and purpose of God.  This was not something God was doing for a particular time or dispensation, but applies to all Christians in the face of trials.<br /><br />“It’s Rising Up” speaks of the kingdom rule of God being ushered in by the voice of man.  But “Blessed Be Your Name” says that God’s kingdom is already here, though hurricanes and war and poverty and the like may cause us to unduly question God’s rule.<br /><br />In Job 38-39, Yahweh presents his case to Job, detailing all the aspects of his sovereignty over earthly life for two chapters straight, and then he challenges Job to find fault with the way he rules the earth.  But Job is silent:<br />&lt;p&gt;<span class="chapter-num" id="v18040001-1"></span>&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;<span class="chapter-num" id="v18040001-1"></span>And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Job:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="block-indent"&gt; &lt;p class="line-group"&gt;<span class="verse-num" id="v18040002-1"></span>“Shall a faultfinder contend with the Almighty?<br /><span class="indent"></span>He who argues with God, let him answer it.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;<span class="verse-num" id="v18040003-1"></span>Then Job answered the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> and said:&lt;/p&gt;   <span class="verse-num" id="v18040004-1">”</span>Behold, I am of small account; what shall I answer you?<br /><span class="indent"></span>I lay my hand on my mouth.”<br /><br />– Job 40:1-4 (ESV)<br />&lt;/blockquote&gt;God’s kingdom is already here, and those who live as if he is not the one with dominion over this orb shall find themselves absent from the kingdom when Christ returns in his glory.<br />&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;<img width="1" height="1" src="" alt="" />&lt;/div&gt;</p>

If our first is a boy (we will, Lord willing, find out next Monday), we will name him Baxter.  When we told Pat, he was like, “Oh, like Richard Baxter!”<br /><br />In addition to the fact that we love the name, there are additional reasons why Baxter is cool.<br /><br />Jonathan Edwards is one of my favorite authors, mainly because of his influence in John Piper’s life, but also because I have found his thought in <i>A Careful and Strict Enquiry into the Modern Prevailing Notions of that Freedom of the Will, Which Is Supposed to be Essential to Moral Agency, Vertue and Vice, Reward and Punishment, Praise and Blame</i> (<i>Freedom of the Will</i>, for short) to be so compelling.  The quotes below are from the Speaker Interviews session at the <a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/ResourceLibrary/ConferenceMessages/ByConference/3/">2003 Desiring God Conference</a> on Jonathan Edwards and a God-Entranced Vision of All Things.  I highly recommend downloading the audio from all the sessions.<br /><br />Mark Dever asks, “If having a God-enthralled life is what we’re about as Christians, can you suggest one other author that’s been helpful to you in helping to accomplish that in your life and heart, and that you would commend to people, Jim?”<br /><br />J.I. Packer’s response: <br /><br />&lt;blockquote&gt;Richard Baxter, most definitely.  He actually wrote a treatise on delighting in God, and it’s rich and thrilling stuff, as is <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1573832839?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=lbmusic&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1573832839">The Saints’ Everlasting Rest</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=lbmusic&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1573832839" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" /></i>, as is <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0851511910?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=lbmusic&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0851511910">The Reformed Pastor</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=lbmusic&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0851511910" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" /></i>, as is just about everything contained in his enormous Christian directory.  I root for Baxter as a writer on practical religion.  People like William Wilberforce never tired of reading Baxter, and he’s not the only one.  I don’t tire of reading him.

Beougher:<br /><br />&lt;blockquote&gt;On the Lord’s Days there was no disorder to be seen in the streets, but you might hear an hundred families singing Psalms and repeating sermons as you passed through the streets.  In a word, when I came thither first, there was about one family in a street that worshipped God and called on his name, and when I came away there were some streets where there was not passed one family in the side of a street that did not so; and that did not by professing serious godliness, give us hopes of their sincerity.  (p. 13)&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br />Baxter had a God-enthralled vision of life, and it overflowed in his powerful influence as a winner of souls in the towns in which he labored, to the point that you could walk to church and every single home you passed on the way there belonged to one of your members who would be on their way shortly.

      <p><a href="http://www.challies.com/archives/articles/who-do-you-love-more.php">Here is a powerful post from Tim Challies</a> about why he loves his wife more than his children and told them as much.<br /><br />I expect that it is the same with the Father’s love for the Elect, his children.  He loves them because they reflect his image to him, because they remind him of the Son, because when he looks at us, he sees Jesus.  However, His love for the Son is first and foremost.<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;The Godhead being thus begotten by God’s loving an idea of Himself and shewing forth in a distinct subsistence or person in that idea, there proceeds a most pure act, and an infinitely holy and sacred energy arises between the Father and Son in mutually loving and delighting in each other, for their love and joy is mutual […] We may learn by the Word of God that the Godhead or the Divine nature and essence does subsist in love. (I John 4:8) “He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.” In the context of which place I think it is plainly intimated to us that the Holy Spirit is that Love, as in the 12th and 13th verses. “If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and His love is perfected in us; hereby know we that we dwell in Him … because He hath given us of His Spirit.”  Jonathan Edwards, <a href="http://www.iclnet.org/pub/resources/text/ipb-e/epl-10/web/edwards-essay-trinity.html"><span style="font-style:italic;">On the Trinity</span></a><br />&lt;/blockquote&gt;Without the love of a husband and wife for each other, there would be no children to love.  In a similar way, without God the Father’s love for himself, we would not have the Son, and we would not have creation or redemption.  Without God the Father’s love for the Son, we would not have the Holy Spirit, and the means of our regeneration.  So it is right and proper to say that God’s love for himself is infinitely greater than his love for his children.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <p>This is from page 44 of <a>What’s So Great About the Doctrines of Grace?</a> by Richard D. Phillips:&lt;blockquote&gt;Were no one ever condemned–were there no display of God's judgment  and wrath–there would be no knowledge of the glories of God's grace.   In that case, the true God would be unknown to His creatures, and His  purpose in creation–to display the fullness of His glory–would be unrealized.  Having failed in this purpose, God would no longer be  God.  For this reason, God's decree of reprobation is necessary.  God being perfect in every attribute, it is necessary for His every  attribute to be exercised: goodness in creation, power in triumph,  mercy in grace, and justice in wrath.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Sent from my iPhone&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;<img width="1" height="1" src="" alt="" />&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <h2><a href="/2008/07/31/the-end-for-which-god-created-the-world/">The End for Which God Created the World</a></h2>
      <p>What follows is from a message from the 2003 Desiring God Conference that I was listening to on the way to work.  John Piper quotes from Edwards’ book, <span style="font-style:italic;">The End for Which God Created the World</span>, which is one of the most important books I have ever read.<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;God is the beginning, the middle, and the end of <em>all things</em>. Nothing exists without his creating it. Nothing stays in being without his sustaining word. Everything has its reason for existing from him. Therefore nothing can be understood apart from him, and all understandings of all things that leave him out are superficial understandings, since they leave out the most important reality in the universe. We can scarcely begin to feel today how God-ignoring we have become, because it is the very air we breathe.<br /><br />[…]<br /><br />Listen as he [Edwards] weaves together God’s joy in being God and our joy in his being God:<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;   Because [God] infinitely values his own glory, consisting in the  knowledge of himself, love to himself . . . <strong><em>joy in  himself</em></strong>; he therefore valued the image, communication  or participation of these, in the creature. And it is because he  values himself, that he delights in the knowledge, and love, and  joy of the creature; as being himself the object of this knowledge,  love and complacence…[Thus] God’s respect to the creature’s good,  and his respect to himself, is not a divided respect; but both are  united in one, as the happiness of the creature aimed at, is  happiness in union with himself.   &lt;/blockquote&gt;In other words, for God to be the holy and righteousness God that he is, he must delight infinitely in what is infinitely delightful. He must enjoy with unbounded joy what is most boundlessly enjoyable; he must take infinite pleasure in what is infinitely pleasant; he must love with infinite intensity what is infinitely lovely; he must be infinitely satisfied with what is infinitely satisfying. If he were not, he would be fraudulent. Claiming to be wise, he would be a fool, exchanging the glory of God for images. God’s joy in God is part of what it means for God to be God.<br /><br />- John Piper, “<a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/ResourceLibrary/ConferenceMessages/ByConference/3/1644_A_GodEntranced_Vision_of_All_Things_Why_We_Need_Jonathan_Edwards_300_Years_Later/">A God-Entranced Vision of All Things</a>”, October 10, 2003&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <p>Free-willers were chatting in the break room today about the “beauty  of free agency”. I tried to pipe in with an observation about Divine  Providence but it was not received. I had to leave the room in order  to avoid upsetting people.<br /><br />Why are so many people convinced that “free will” is a major tenet of the Christian religion?  It’s not taught in the Bible anywhere.  Just look at Romans 8.  Where is free will in there?  Verses 7, 8 (ESV): “For the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God, for it does not submit to God’s law; indeed, it cannot.<span class="verse-num" id="v45008008-1">  </span>Those who are in the flesh cannot please God.”  The unregenerate human soul has no choice but to live a life of degradation.  It is only by the indwelling Spirit of Christ, when we are born again, regenerated (v. 9-11).<br /><br />The paradox is not God’s Sovereignty vs. man’s free will.  It is God’s Sovereignty and human responsibility.  We are responsible for the sins we commit, even though it is in our nature to commit them.<br />&lt;p&gt;Sent from my iPhone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;<img width="1" height="1" src="" alt="" />&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <p>I went to my computer and made the mistake of looking at it. Then it said it couldn’t write to the iTunes library (iTunes was already open). I tried to open Firefox, but it wouldn’t open, some error message about it already being open. Mail was being really slow. Tried force-quit. When I rebooted my computer, nothing came up. There was just a gray apple and the indicator animation. I could tell by the repetitive sound the hard drive was making that something was wrong. I waited a long time and tried again. And again, and again. Found a website on my iPhone that said how to reset the PRAM and use the install disk to repair the hard drive. That didn’t work it said there were errors. Of course there are, that’s why I want to fix it! All attempts to boot in safe mode have failed. Now when I try to boot there is no apple. Just a blank light gray screen for a long time, and then this.</p>

      <p>So, I didn’t even know they wrote a song for the movie.  We left as soon as the credits began because, having just finished the book the night before, we were not impressed at all with the filmmakers’ idea of “poetic license.”<br /><br /><br /><br />I read an article online that pretty well summed up what was wrong with the movie.  I think it was on World Magazine, which requires a paid subscription in order to view the articles online, so I wouldn’t be able to link to it anyway (my Dad linked it to me, which is why I was able to view the article “for a limited time”).  The article mentioned that Aslan was misrepresented (and therefore, so was the Gospel) in that he roared at Trumpkin rather than playing with him.<br /><br />But the biggest issue I had with the movie was the “preventative measures” taking by the Narnians, who chose to attack Miraz’s castle unprovoked, even going to the length of attempted murder, which is in stark contrast to the more Davidic behavior of Prince Caspian and the Pevensies in the book.  I bring up King David because when he never attacked King Saul, and even when his son Absolom rose up against him, he sounded a retreat rather than risk shedding royal blood.<br /><br />C. S. Lewis was a theologian more than he was a novelist.  He wrote what he wrote for a reason.  I wish they wouldn’t have messed with the story.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;<img width="1" height="1" src="" alt="" />&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <p>The Big Two when it comes to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_%28file_format%29">RSS</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_%28standard%29">Atom</a> feed readers are <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/">Bloglines</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/view/#overview-page">Google  Reader</a>. I started using Bloglines years ago to keep track of my  friends’ Xanga entries. Nobody I know uses Xanga anymore, but I continued  using Bloglines to manage my blog subscriptions.  Now they have a   public beta version, which is pretty cool.  And I’ve been using their  iPhone version to read blogs on my iPhone.&lt;p&gt;Bloglines was fine when all I wanted to do was be notified that  someone had updated their blog (by way of the indicator in the system  tray), but then I used to go directly to the blog to read the post,  and perhaps even leave comments. But now there is so much more content  available via RSS/Atom syndication, so it has become necessary to use  the feed reader to read content as well. Furthermore, the mobile  versions are optimized for reading on the iPhone, and you can’t say  that about every individual blog out there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, I am making the switch to Bloglines’ chief competitor, Google  Reader.  My chief complaint with Bloglines (standard) is that when you  view a feed, it automatically marks all available entries as read.  They seem to be addressing this issue with the beta version, but this  doesn’t help on the iPhone, which retrieves 5 entries at a time (and  marks them as read).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Reader, however, uses Ajax technology to mark an entry as read  based on whether the entry is visible in your browser! This is a much  better method of keeping track of your blog subscriptions, because  you’re guaranteed not to miss anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only down side, I think, to Google Reader is the smaller font  size. But if you hold the phone sideways (landscape mode), it’s a bit  bigger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tips: If you’re using Google Reader on the iPhone, push the plus sign  at the bottom of the screen and add it to your home screen (with a  nifty little icon, too!). Also, in the footer next to the copyright,  you can select “Mobile” or “Classic”. To use the best iPhone version,  select “Mobile”. It makes use if Ajax’s asynchronous loading of data  and has more features than the other version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, and on another note, the brand-new MySpace App on iPhone 2.0 rocks!!!  The  comments interface is great. And you can even upload photos straight  from your phone (unfortunately, you can’t move them to a different  folder, though). What I really don’t get, though, is why you need to  fill out a stinkin’ captcha form if you’re using an iPhone! Still, the  app is cleaner and more elegant than any other form of MySpace interface I’ve ever seen, and just might make MySpace something I’ll  enjoy using again!  (It doesn’t let you view or edit blogs, but who uses MySpace for blogging anyway?)<br />&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sent from my iPhone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;P.S.

<p>Today I went with my wife to her first prenatal doctor’s appointment. We got to listen to the little one’s heartbeat for the very first time. It was beating precisely in double-time with the mother’s (our baby’s already got rhythm!). It was very eye-opening, opening the door wide into parenthood, making the experience much more tangible and real.

      <h2><a href="/2008/06/07/new-blogging-format/">New blogging format</a></h2>
      <p>Perhaps you’ve noticed I haven’t blogged in a while. One reason is that I’ve been busy with family life, with my beautiful bride Christina.  And another is my busy church life. Another reason I haven’t blogged is that I had been intending to upgrade to the latest version of MovableType so that I could take advantage of the CAPTCHA plug-in to block comment spam.  But upgrading MovableType is such a pain…<br />&lt;p&gt;So, I decided to switch from MovableType to Blogger. For one thing,  I have high praise for Google’s technology, with Gmail’s spam fighting technology and smooth Ajaxian interface, their powerful search engine, and cool developer tools like <a href="http://gears.google.com">Google Gears</a>.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another reason for the switch is that MovableType does not work very  well on Windows servers, and as a .NET developer, of course my site is hosted on Windows. Also, upgrading MovableType is a pain. With  Google’s Blogger, the posting interface is online, and their software  updates are therefore automatic. This should therefore remove the  obstacles to posting new blogs.

      <h2><a href="/2007/09/08/hearst-and-graham/">Hearst and Graham&#8230;</a></h2>
      <p>I found an interesting article by Cecilia Rasmussen from the L.A. Times <a href="http://www.latimes.com/features/religion/la-me-then2sep02,1,449759.story">commemorating Billy Graham’s 1949 crusades</a> in Los Angeles.  It’s an excellent read, I highly recommend it.<br /><br />William Randolph Hearst’s legacy is in stark contrast to Graham’s.  When my friends Paul and Laurie came back from their honeymoon, they had a lot to say about <a href="http://www.getunderground.com/underground/columns/article.cfm?Article_ID=2244">their visit to the Hearst castle</a>.  But one of the things that was interesting about this L.A. Times piece was that Hearst reportedly visited to hear Graham preach, and was so impressed that he subsequently instructed all of the editors of his conglomeration of newspapers to promote Graham’s crusade with “puff” pieces, and the media exposure is one of the things that resulted in the crusade continuing for 8 weeks due to all the people who kept showing up.  What if that bastard Hearst actually got saved two years before he died?  I suppose there would have been visible fruit, that he would have put his house in order if this were the case.  Then again, maybe he was sick in a wheelchair and couldn’t do much about it while his empire and estate were perpetuated by the inertia set in prior years?  Hmm…  Guess we’ll find out one day.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <p>Just a while back, I posted a video talking about Mark Driscoll’s banned church planting video, and how after I watched it, the Lord convicted me to stop wasting my time playing World of Warcraft, and I started focusing my attention on reading some good theology books, encouraging Pat to take up the mantle of Pastor, spending lots of time with the home group I’ve been a part of since I moved back to Chico (which I was also a part of before I left!), and learning some old hymns on the guitar; all of this working towards planting our new church, <a href="http://www.sovereignjoycf.org/">Sovereign Joy Christian Fellowship</a>.<br /><br />Last Friday I started noting a rapid increase in the number of views my video was getting.  Now, I know it’s only like one-tenth of a percent of the kind of exposure that people like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/Nalts">Nalts</a> or Perez Hilton get, but still—it’s a lot for me!<br /><br />A handful of people from the Mars Hill community in Seattle e-mailed me to thank me for the video, saying it was a great encouragement to them.  Scott Thomas, director of the <a href="http://www.acts29network.org/">Acts 29 Network</a>, was the one who actually journeyed to Florida to bring the ill-fated DVDs to the conference, and he dropped me a short note to tell me my testimony made the whole fiasco worthwhile!<br /><br />Then I got another comment from someone on the video team, who was also very encouraged to hear that the video was actually making an impact somehow.  From this, I figured someone up in Seattle must have been passing my video around, and that must by why I got so many views…  Turns out, Mark Driscoll himself apparently watched it and got a kick out of it, and then he posted a link on their church’s private member-only forum!<br /><br />Awesome!  Although I am a little embarrassed now that I know he’s seen it, because of all those times I leaned into the camera and said, “This guy’s hardcore!”  But it’s super encouraging to learn that I’m being an encouragement to them, you know?  It’s like a special kind of encouragement that goes both ways, because when they express how encouraged they are, it reciprocates and I am encouraged right back!  This is like a super-cool trick that Jesus designed into the body of Christ that somehow is much too rare these days!<br /><br />You can <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mbm6lDzKH1U">watch it here</a> if you haven’t already, and make sure you rate it 5 stars!!!<br /><br />It sure would be nice if the Resurgence would approve it on YouTube page as a video response to the original <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIrIKbCz3n4">Driscoll video</a>.  That’s probably how they found out about it in the first place, because I submitted the video as a comment.  But it’s not showing up on their page…  Oh well.  God is sovereign!  And it’s not about us anyway!&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <h2><a href="/2007/07/09/some-thoughts-on-particular-redemption/">Some thoughts on Particular Redemption</a></h2>
      <p>This is what Scripture says:<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;For to this you have been called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, so that you might follow in his steps.  He committed no sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth.  When he was reviled, he did not revile in return; when he suffered, he did not threaten, but continued entrusting himself to him who judges justly.  He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness.  By his wounds <i>you have been healed</i>.  For you were straying like sheep, but have now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.  (1 Peter 2:21-25, ESV)&lt;/blockquote&gt;Particular Redemption is the historic reformed doctrine that attempts to answer the question: “Who did Jesus die for?”  In 1 Peter 2:21, the Holy Spirit, speaking through Peter’s hand, says “Christ…suffered for you”, and in verse 24, that he “bore our sins in his body on the tree.”  Who is signified by “you” and “us” in those verses?  If you look at Peter’s salutation in 1:1, you see he’s writing to the “<i>elect</i> exiles of the dispersion”, and in verse 2, that they are elect “according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in the sanctification of the Spirit, for obedience to Jesus Christ and for sprinkling with his blood.”  In verse 3, we see that Christ, in his “great mercy”, “has <i>caused <u>us</u></i> to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.”  This is the same “us” as those whose sins Christ bore on the tree in 1 Peter 2:24.  It is the group that includes the author (Simon Peter) and the people he’s writing to (the elect exiles): namely, believers.  (And when Peter says that he “suffered for you”, he is in no way denying the fact that Christ suffered for Peter as well.)<br /><br />So when he says, Jesus “suffered for you” and that he bore the penalty for “our sins” on the cross,  he’s talking about a specific group of people, already known to God.  Judicially (it says God is a just judge, v. 23), you cannot be punished twice for the same crime.  Jesus bore our punishment, so we cannot be punished again.<br /><br />Rob Bell, who is one of the leaders on the forefront of the “emergent” movement, says<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;Heaven is full of forgiven people.<br /><br />Hell is full of forgiven people.<br /><br />Heaven is full of people God loves, whom Jesus died for.<br /><br />Hell is full of people God loves, whom Jesus died for.<br /><br />The difference is how we choose to live, which story we choose to live in, which version of reality we trust.  (<i>Velvet Elvis</i>, p. 146)&lt;/blockquote&gt;This is very, very bad.<br /><br />You can’t go to hell if Jesus died for you, because he already carried out your sentence!  If Jesus died for you, you are forgiven, and God already sees the debt as cancelled!  Friends, if you trust in Christ, he has already borne your sins “in his body on the tree,” and “By his wounds you have been healed.”  This is why when Jesus died, he said, “It is finished” (Gr. <i>tetelestai</i> i.e. “paid in full”).<br /><br />What follows is from A.W. Pink’s book, <i>The Sovereignty of God</i>:<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;The very <i>nature</i> of the Atonement evidences that, in its application to sinners, it was <i>limited</i> in the <i>purpose</i> of God.  The Atonement of Christ may be considered from two chief viewpoints–Godward and manward.  Godwards, the Cross-work of Christ was a <i>propitiation</i>, an appeasing of Divine wrath, a satisfaction rendered to Divine justice and holiness; manwards, it was a <i>substitution</i>, the Innocent taking the place of the guilty, the Just dying for the unjust.  But a strict substitution of a Person for persons, and the infliction upon Him of voluntary sufferings, involve the <i>definite recognition</i> on the part of the Substitute and of the One He is to propitiate <i>of the persons for whom He acts,</i> whose sins He bears, whose legal obligations He discharges.  Furthermore, if the Law-giver accepts the satisfaction which is made by the Substitute, then those for whom the Substitute acts, whose place He takes, must necessarily be acquitted.  If I am in debt and unable to discharge it and another comes forward and pays my creditor in full and receives a receipt in acknowledgment, then, in the sight of the law, my creditor no longer has any claim upon me.  On the Cross the Lord Jesus gave Himself a ransom, and that it was accepted by God was attested by the empty grave three days later [the Resurrection is the receipt or proof of purchase that the Father gave to the Son to acknowledge the debt he paid!]; the question we would here raise is, <i>For whom</i> was this ransom offered?  If it was offered for all mankind then the debt incurred by every man has been cancelled.  If Christ bore in His own body on the tree the sins of all mean without exception, then none will perish.  If Christ was “made a curse” for all of Adam’s race then none will be finally condemned.  “Payment God cannot <i>twice</i> demand, first at my bleeding Surety’s hand and then again at mine.”  But Christ <i>did not</i> discharge the debt of all men without exception, for some there are who will be “cast into prison” (cf. 1 Peter 3:19 where the same Greek word for “prison” occurs), and they shall “by no means come out thence, till they have <i>paid</i> the uttermost farthing,” which will never, never be.  Christ <i>did not</i> bear the sins of all mankind, for some there are who “die <i>in their sins</i>” (John 8:21), and whose “sin remaineth” (John 9:41).  Christ <i>was not</i> “made a curse” for all of Adam’s race, for some there are to whom He will yet say, “Depart from Me <i>ye cursed”</i> (Matt. 25:41).  To say that Christ died for all alike, to say that He became the Substitute and Surety of the whole human race, to say that He suffered on behalf of and in the stead of all mankind, is to say that He “bore the curse for many who are now bearing the curse for themselves; that He suffered punishment for many who are now lifting up their own eyes in Hell, beign in torments; that He paid the redemption price for many who shall yet pay in their own eternal anguish ‘the wages of sin, which is death’” (G.S. Bishop).  But, on the other hand, so say as Scripture says, that Christ was stricken for the transgressions <i>of God’s people,</i> to say that He gave His life <i>for the sheep,</i> to say that He gave His life a ransom <i>for many, is to</i> say that He made an atonement which <i>fully</i> atones; it is to say He paid a price which actually ransoms; it is to say He was set forth as a propitiation which really propitiates; it is to say He is a Savior who truly saves. (pp. 58-60)&lt;/blockquote&gt;(This paragraph mainly deals with the judicial analysis of the atonement, but in the surrounding pages, Pink lists and explicates on the relevant scriptures that deal with the subject.)<br /><br />O Christian, God is the Shepherd and Overseer of our souls.  Let us be eternally grateful that, while we were wandering away like sheep, he came after us, sending his One and Only Son to suffer in our stead, paying the price for our sins, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness, to the praise of his glory!&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;<img width="1" height="1" src="" alt="" />&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <p>Although the idea of community is a huge part of the Christian life (Gr. <i>ekklesia</i>: translated “church” in the NT–“kirk” if you’re Scottish), there is a huge danger on relying on what the people outside of yourself think about you and how you’re doing.  All that they’re seeing is what they can see.  People can appear to be Christians just by behaving a certain way, saying certain words, doing certain things.  But that is not where our life in Christ exists.<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;The great enemy to the Lord Jesus Christ in the present day is the conception of practical work that has not come from the New Testament, but from the systems of the world in which endless energy and activites are insisted upon, but no private life with God.  The emphasis is put on the wrong thing.  Jesus said, “The kingdom of God cometh not with observation, for lo the kingdom of God is within you,” a hidden, obscure thing.  An active Christian worker too often lives in the shop window.  It is the innermost of the innermost that reveals the power of the life.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;We have to get rid of the plague of the spirit of the religious age in which we live.  In Our Lord’s life there was none of the press and rush of tremendous activity that we regard so highly, and the disciple is to be as His Master.  The central thing about the kingom of Jesus Christ is a personal relationship to Himself, not public usefulness to men.  (Oswald Chambers, <a href="http://www.rbc.org/utmost/index.php?month=10&amp;day=19&amp;year=06"><i>My Utmost for His Highest</i></a>, October 19)&lt;/blockquote&gt;You have to know Jesus for yourself, and consider that relationship more important than all others, and your unity with Christ has to be more important than your unity with your brothers and sisters.  When Jesus prayed for us in the garden of Gethsemane, he prayed “that they may all be one, ust as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be in us, so that the world may believe that you have sent me” (John 17:21, ESV).  The unity that we have must be in the Father and the Son, or it is nothing but meaninglessness and vanity.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</p>

And I am thankful for the Lord’s providence in this.  He brought me to the place where I was ready to move back even if the only job I could get was just another mcjob making $8/hr.  And then he drops this in my lap!  I am excited for the opportunity to grow, to be a part of a department that will stretch me and grow me, where they even have other programmers who might actually be better than me!  Also, I am excited about the fact that the company is product-driven rather than sales-driven.  I’ll be a part of building something of value, something that’s worthwhile (rather than just providing a program to support salespeople at a company where they don’t even follow up to make sure the customers are getting the things they pay for).  I’m also really excited about seeing all of my friends and being back in their lives on a regular basis!

      <h2><a href="/2006/10/01/intentional-poverty/">Intentional Poverty</a></h2>
      <p>I thought it was about time for an update on what’s going on with me.<br /><br />I took a week unpaid leave a couple weeks ago and went to Chico.  I got to spend a lot of time with Erica, Jason, Sean &amp; Piña.  I also got to spend time with Pat &amp; Andi Mathers, and that was very special to me.  Pat has a lot of vision and passion for what his new church is all about, and it resonated when he shared it with me.  It coincides with things I’ve been learning from my own Bible studies, and from books I’ve been reading, podcasts I’ve been listening to (<a href="http://www.desiringgodradio.org/">John Piper</a>, <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=77799289&amp;s=143441&amp;i=5039381">Derek Webb</a>), and the music I’m listening to as well (<a href="http://www.freederekwebb.com/">Derek Webb</a>, The Discarded, <a href="http://www.billybragg.co.uk/">Billy Bragg</a>).  The topic that I think the Holy Spirit is putting on my heart is that of intentional poverty.<br /><br />I recently had the opportunity to apologize to my friend Chase for not keeping my doors opened to him at a point last summer when he needed it.  The reason I shut him out was because the doors had been shut on me, metaphorically speaking.  I was unemployed at the time, and then when I got a new job, it was at about half of what I was making before.  Still, compared to millions of people in Africa and Asia, I was living like a king.  In my current financial situation, I found myself wishing I could do it all over again, <i>with the money I’m making now</i>.  I’d totally be able to take care of people!  However, recently a whole change has come about in my thinking about this, and that is, I need to get rid of that italicized “with” part at the end of the do-it-all-over-again statement.<br /><br />God is my provider, whether I’m making what I’m making now, or minimum wage, or am unemployed.  We’re supposed to take care of one another.  Even if you’re unemployed, but still have a roof over your head, well, you still have something to give to another person who is also unemployed but does not have a roof.  And it’s worth the risk, even if you both end up on the street later on.  At least you won’t be alone.  I still wish I could do it all over again, even without the cash.  And I now recognize that I should have poured myself out and given of what little I had at that time.<br /><br />Jesus said whatever you do to the least of these, you do it unto me.<br /><br />I have my friends in Chico to thank for this whole shift in mindset.  If it wasn’t for them, I’d probably have gotten a new car by now, and if I had, then I wouldn’t have the flexibility and freedom to do what I think might very well be the next step.  And this is what I mean by intentional poverty: I am praying about quitting my job and moving back to Chico, even if the only job I can get there is one for $8/hr.  Life is not about your career.  It’s about what you do for the Kingdom, and the value you have in being a friend to others, and, most importantly, in glorifying God.  A career can actually distract you from this.  And if you value health insurance and retirement savings more than doing the work of the Kingdom, then there’s something wrong with you.<br />When Pat was talking about The Orchard, there were two things he mentioned that stood out to me in a big way.  First, he mentioned how the church was given opportunities to move into a building on the other side of town, but they turned it down and decided to remain in Chapmantown, among the poor.  One reason they did this is because there are people in that church who can only come because it’s within walking distance.  If the church moved to California Park or the Pleasant Valley area, they wouldn’t be able to come.  Also, they believe the people they are supposed to reach are the people in that area who aren’t being targeted by any other ministries.<br /><br />Secondly, Pat said the pastor does not go out of the way to please rich people, or to make sure that they are not offended.  He even spoke of an instance when rich people got up and left in the middle of the service because they were uncomfortable among the homeless.  I think that’s great!  I think as a Christian, you hope that your leaders would truly be above reproach, and that they would have a biblical mindset that would not play favorites, but the sad thing is that this is not usually the case.  Jesus even spoke about this whole place of honor thing, saying, “For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted” (Luke 14:11, ESV).  Similary, Christ’s own brother, James the Just, wrote:<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;My brothers, show no partiality as you hold the faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory. For if a man wearing a gold ring and fine clothing comes into your assembly, and a poor man in shabby clothing also comes in, and if you pay attention to the one who wears the fine clothing and say, “You sit here in a good place,” while you say to the poor man, “You stand over there,” or, “Sit down at my feet,” have you not then made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts? Listen, my beloved brothers, has not God chosen those who are poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom, which he has promised to those who love him? But you have dishonored the poor man. Are not the rich the ones who oppress you, and the ones who drag you into court? Are they not the ones who blaspheme the honorable name by which you were called? (James 2:1-7, ESV)&lt;/blockquote&gt;With so many modern evangelical churches in America going the way of the megachurch, with expensive mortgages, big screens and flashy lights, and pastors with fancy cars and huge houses, they cannot afford to be biblical when it comes to this, because they need the rich man’s donations in order to remain comfortable in their ways.  So, to see this verse walked out in real life is a breath of fresh air!&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <h2><a href="/2006/08/05/zen-and-the-art-of-control-freaking/">Zen and the Art of Control Freaking</a></h2>
      <p>Sometimes God teaches us through circumstance.  For instance, he might govern things so that as we read through the Bible, we come to a certain passage at the opportune time, so that it corresponds with other circumstances around us that serve to illustrate a theological lesson.<br /><br />This morning in my quiet time I was reading chapters 44 and 45 in the book of Isaiah.  They are all about God’s sovereignty over all things, and how worthy he is to have a plan over it all, and righteous and just to actually implement that plan.<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;“Shower, O heavens, from above,<br />  and let the clouds rain down righteousness;<br />let the earth open, that salvation and<br />    righteousness may bear fruit;<br />  let the earth cause them both to sprout;<br />  I the LORD have created it.<br /><br />“Woe to him who strives with him who formed him,<br />  a pot among earthen pots!<br />Does the clay say to him who forms it,<br />  ‘What are you making?’<br />  or ‘Your work has no handles’?<br />Woe to him who says to a father,<br />    ‘What are you begetting?’<br />  or to a woman, ‘With what are you in labor?’” (Isaiah 45:8-9, ESV)&lt;/blockquote&gt;My illustrations and insights are inadequate, but I’m going to attempt a little commentary on life here.  I think people believe they can control certain things, but in reality their idea of control is only an illusion.  We had an illusion of security here in America, which was so horribly shattered at Liberty and Church in New York on September 11.  There was an illusion of control in New Orleans, when man’s attempts to wall up the sea were proved so inadequate last summer.<br /><br />My first contemporary illustration seems rather light in comparison with these.  In baseball, there are crazy statisticians who go nuts with numbers, and they act as if these numbers are going to accurately predict what’s going to happen in a given game, but there are so many variables that make the numbers irrelevant.  And then there are coaches who use these numbers to govern their choices during the trading season.  They’ll make moves that they think will help the team, but these moves can actually hurt more than they help.  Case in point: At different points in the last few weeks, the Padres have dropped veterans Vinnie Castilla and Eric Young from the lineup, in order to make room for relief pitcher Scott Williamson and third baseman (he’s trying) Todd Walker.  However, although they’re still in first place in the N.L. West, both of these trades resulted in small slumps for the Padres, and I think it’s due to Vinnie and E.Y. being missing from the roster.  Young Adrian Gonzalez looked up to Vinnie as a mentor, and although his hitting streak lasted another several games, he hasn’t been playing as well as he had before Vinnie left.  The so-called experts think they can improve matters by doing certain things, but human beings are not machines.  There is a relationship factor, and a team factor, where each person plays a distinct role, but the cohesive unit is organic because its parts are organic, and is therefore unpredictable on a certain level.<br /><br />An issue that has been in the news lately is the issue of stem cell research.  Lots of people are rather upset with George W. Bush because he vetoed this bill that would grant federal funding to labs doing research on embryonic stem cells.  However, I just read a very interesting article in <i>Time Magazine</i> (August 7 issue) which contrasted the hopeful expectations of the ESC (embryonic stem cell) researchers (who are finding that ESC’s have a high potential to produce tumors) with the real-life miracles worked by the scientists who have been using umbilical and adult stem cells.  You see, the issue has been so highly politicized, as if ESC’s are the answer to everybody’s problems; as if Bush has just signed the death warrant of billions of people.<br /><br />This blog entry is about the illusion of control.  And the fact is, scientists don’t yet have a way to understand or explain what will cause a stem cell to turn into the specialized type of tissue they want it to become, whereas adult stem cells are stable and can be expected to work a certain way.  In the article, they quote Dr. Joanne Kurtzberg, of Duke University Medical Center, whose research has resulted in a cure for fatal blood diseases in children.<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;“In some cases, you may not want to go all the way back to embryonic stem cells,” says Kurtzberg.  “You may want something more specific or less likely to stray.  You wouldn’t want to put a cell in the brain and find out later that it turned into bone.” (Nancy Gibbs, “Stem Cells: the Hope and the Hype”, <i>Time Magazine</i>, August 7, 2006, p. 46)&lt;/blockquote&gt;Democrats have made a huge deal out of this issue because they think it will help them gain seats in Congress.  But this is pure politics, irresponsibly preying on the hope of the sick and downtrodden (which the Bible condemns), with no scientific proof.  The fact is, in order to get any viable research done on ESC’s, the scientists will need many more embryos to work with than those that they could have gotten from the in-vitro fertilization clinics the bill would have given them access to.  And this raises many other ethical questions regarding cloning or the fertilization of new embryos for the express purpose of research.<br /><br />There are three points I want to make about the ESC issue.  1. Don’t believe everything a Democrat or movie star tells you without checking the facts for yourself.  2. If you have any questions about this field, I recommend the <i>Time</i> article.  3. Control is an illusion.  There will always remain some mysteries in science.  There are certain things that are up to God and him alone, and one of these might possibly be the governing of which embryonic stem cell is going to turn into tissue for which vital organ.  On the other hand, it’s possible that God has granted unto man the gift of reason to figure this out; it might be scientifically possible to find the answer, but ethically, the pursuit of this research will be immoral until they can figure out how to harvest ESC’s without harming the embryo.  Until then, the destruction of embryos and the reckless injection of blank stem cells without understanding all the factors that govern its development into vital tissue is just irresponsible and dangerous.<br /><br />(If we’re going to examine the ethics, we have to look into the field which is producing all these wasted embryos as well, and that is the field of in vitro fertilization.  There are millions of orphans around the world who need adults who will take care of them.  Why can’t infertile couples adopt these orphans in the first place instead of contributing to the mass of frozen embryos that has caused this latest controversy?)<br /><br />The idea of human control of our surroundings only works up to a certain point, and when we get beyond that point, things become dangerous.  In New Orleans, there were people who knew the levy system was weak, but they didn’t do anything about it.  In California, people have knowingly built football stadiums on top of fault lines.  Granted, natural disasters are properly referred to as Acts of God.  But he has given us brains, and to play with fate on the fault lines or in the hurricane zone is very irresponsible.  Humans need to admit where they have no control.  And they need to get rid of the arrogance that supposes that the “big one” won’t come in our time, or at least won’t come in the middle of a football game when 50,000 people are gathered in one place (God used Samson to kill a bunch of Philistines in a stadium once).<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, “The word of the LORD that you have spoken is good.” For he thought, “There will be peace and security in my days.” (Isaiah 39:8, ESV)&lt;/blockquote&gt;We need to work in cohesion, agreement, and submission with God’s works.  If the historical and geological proof is that there is a certain region in God’s creation where a certain type of disaster always happens, we need to be submissive to that fact in that region and govern our own actions accordingly.  If the scientific proof is that there are certain things that we don’t understand, we need to not pretend that we understand them until we do, and to not politicize the situation as if we already know.<br /><br />I used to hate Calvinists because I felt like all they did was sit around on their duffs, with a “Que será, será” attitude, and I felt that this attitude was what was responsible for the abominable decline of Christianity in formerly-devout, Calvinistic Scotland, where the gothic cathedrals have been hollowed out and converted into night clubs, and less than 10 percent of the population are believers.<br /><br />It was an unfair judgment.  Calvinism wasn’t responsible for this.  It was a general lack of belief in God’s power and supremacy, and it happened all over Europe during the Age of Reason and the Age of Progress, when Mankind attempted to take over the throne of the universe and Humanism became the new religion.  And the same thing has been happening in America ever since the infamous Scopes monkey trial.<br /><br />Even so, God is sovereign and in control over all of this.  Thousands of years ago he used periods of oppression and persecution in Israel’s history in order that he might preserve a remnant and bring out a renewal of devotion on the other side of it when things were restored.  It was during the Roman occupation of Palestine that God intervened and implanted himself as a covert operative, and from there the Gospel began to spread around the globe.  Even today, he has a plan that we can only guess at.  Man has a responsibility to glorify him in all things.  It was what we were created to do.  When more people start to live life in this way, maybe we will meet with more successful results.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;<img width="1" height="1" src="" alt="" />&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <h2><a href="/2006/07/29/getting-back-in-the-saddle/">Getting back in the saddle</a></h2>
      <p>I’ve been asked by the pastor of a very small congregation to lead worship place of my Dad tomorrow morning, because he’s driving my Mom to Henderson to see Gayle Erwin teach (lucky…).<br /><br />For those of you who don’t know, I’ve been on a sort of musical hiatus ever since I left Calvary Chapel of Chico.  I’ve been digging into the scriptures, reading books, and listening to John Piper’s Desiring God Radio podcast during this time while I’ve been re-evaluating what worship is really all about.  I’ve also been comparing this “ideal”, or the biblical standard of worship (see ch. 7, “The Inner Simplicity and Outer Freedom of Worldwide Worship” in Piper’s book <i>Let the Nations Be Glad</i> to get a glimpse of what I’m talking about), with what I’ve been observing on the stages of local churches, a presentation of something which is distinctly and emphatically NOT what worship is about.<br /><br />I feel so strongly convicted about what worship is, that I don’t want to participate in something that I know it’s not.  I’ve been seriously convicted regarding the use of that word.  It doesn’t mean what we think it means.  And the modern-day evangelical church has come to use it to refer to the sing-along time which comes before the announcements, the passing of the offering bucket, and the preacher getting up to speak.  But worship is a lifestyle, not a sing-along.<br /><br />When I left Calvary Chico and started going to a fellowship on campus at Chico State called “The Edge”, it was really cool.  Worship–or the sing-along thing we refer to as “worship”–wasn’t just a sing-along.  It was a real experience of entering into the throne room of God!  It’s becoming rarer these days, and I don’t understand why!  I have a real sensitivity to the worshipper’s heart in people I see leading worship, and if they don’t have it, I tune out right away.  And it’s something that’s so much bigger than technical expertise.<br /><br />It seems like so often people feel like they must put a band together and have a PowerPoint presentation, for the sole reason being that it’s just the way it’s done these days.  The sadness is that often “worship” of this type just plain stinks.  I’ve been spoiled by my time in southern California, being surrounded by so much God-given talent being properly exerted for God’s glory in worship music.  But there’s a difference between a genuine expression according to the gifts God’s given you, and trying to do something because that’s what everyone else is doing.  Worship must first of all be genuine, and you’re more likely to find a single guitar player or piano player with a genuine worshiper’s heart than you are to find a whole band.  And it is my belief that you shouldn’t have a band for the sake of having a band.<br /><br />The ideal worship expression for me is in a home fellowship, where you know everybody there is saved and on the same page.  And when this is the case, you can go on for hours!!!  Speaking of home fellowships, I think a big part of the problem with the modern contemporary evangelical congregational expression of worship is directly related to the size of our churches.  We’ve made “worship” an external concert experience rather than an internal stance of devotion and heart-attitude.  I think when Scripture refers to “speaking to one another in songs, hymns, and spiritual songs”, the original context of that was not in a huge temple gathering with all the other Christians in town.  It was in a private home.  Even if you have people sitting on floors and window sills (or falling out of them), you were with a group of people you knew and trusted.  There was heavy persecution at the time, and you didn’t want Judaizer spies turning you in to the Sanhedrin, so the church gathering was private rather than evangelistic.  (The evangelism is what happened on the streets and in the temple courts.  And in the jails.)<br />Contextually, in such an instance of “songs, hymns, and spiritual songs,” you don’t have a ton of people watching you.  It’s not a performance that’s being critiqued, and you don’t have to worry about people not coming back next week.  When the focus group is smaller, the level of talent expectation goes down.  But I believe this has a lot to do with what the gospel is all about: taking ordinary people and leveling the playing field so that it has nothing to do with your status according to what the world sees.  Like when Samuel anointed Saul: “Man looks on the outward appearance, but the LORD looks on the heart.”  I firmly believe there are plenty of people with “three chords and the truth” to be able to have a worship leader in every congregation if all congregations were small enough to fit in somebody’s living room.<br />I used to think about worship as giving to God.  A “sacrifice of praise”. But God does not need anything from us (Acts 17:25). John Piper wrote an excellent assessment in “God’s Passion for His Glory” that’s exactly how I feel:<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;“If the focus in corporate worship shifts onto our giving to God, one result I have seen again and again is that subtly it is not God that remains at the center by the quality of our giving. Are we singing worthily of the Lord? Do the instrumentalists play with a quality befitting a gift to the Lord?… And little by little the focus shifts off the utter indispensability of the Lord himself onto the quality of our performances. And we even start to define excellence and power in worship in terms of the technical distinction of our artistic acts.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;There’s more from John Piper, in Let the Nations Be Glad, ch. 7 (the chapter I mentioned before).  One thing he said is that the OT word for worship is boycotted in the NT because it “did not make clear enough the inward, spiritual nature of true worship.  It carried significant connotations of place and form.  The word was associated with bodily bowing down and with the actual presence of a visible manifestation to bow down before.”  So, when Jesus was there physically, people were “worshipping” him all the time!  And there’s a whole lot of “worship” going on before the throne of God in the book of Revelation.<br /><br />Piper also says (and this one’s a real nugget): “In the New Testament, worship is significantly de-institutionalized, de-localized, de-externalized.  The entire thrust is taken off ceremony and seasons and places and forms and is shifted to what is happening in the heart–not just on Sunday but on every day, and all the time in all of life.”<br /><br />I want to be a part of a community that’s seeking after God, with what Dave Owen used to refer to as “burning at the same spiritual temperature”.  But without the forms and the religiosity.  Without the control of “connected” people heavily influencing church politics, who get upset when you don’t do things their way.  I haven’t found such a place yet, at least not in the town where I am.<br /><br />Brian Tieleman wanted me to come lead worship at their new church plant in Calabasas last month.  Now, I know Tieleman’s heart is always going to be sensitive to provide an atmosphere conducive to worship.  But I don’t think I was ready yet.  The church where I’ll be in the morning is the size of a home fellowship, even though it doesn’t meet in a home.  I kind of wish they did, though.  It would force people to not sit in rows.  And it would probably make them feel uncomfortable if they wore a suit and tie (which is something I don’t approve of in the context of church, unless you’re at a wedding or a funeral.  In the New Testament, church was about sharing your life.  Your real life, not the shiny happy face you put on in business meetings.  I believe dressing up is like wearing a mask.)<br /><br />Though he wears a tie, the pastor is a fan of my dad’s, and very humble about his own skills.  When he asked me if I would do it, I told him it’s been a really long time, but he insisted.  I was thinking about how much I’d love to do it if I were in Scotland, and I believe the missionary heart needs to have the same servant response whether you’re at home or abroad.<br /><br />Here’s the song list:<br />“Shout to the North” (Martin Smith)<br />“In Christ Alone” (Stuart Townend)<br />“My Hope Is Built On Nothing Less” (William Bradbury)<br />“Once Again” (Matt Redman)<br /><br />Other than the hymn, written by a New Englander 150 years ago, all the songs are British.  I felt like getting in the mood for a ministry trip to Scotland &amp; Ireland (even though there’s little chance of that happening any time soon because of my work’s lousy vacation policies).  Also, the pastor is Irish, so is a third of the congregation.<br /><br />My fingers are sore.  I only had a week’s notice to prepare, but that’s no excuse.  Scripture says we need to be ready “in season and out of season.”&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;<img width="1" height="1" src="" alt="" />&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <p><img align="left" alt="The Sledgehammer" src="http://sandiego.padres.mlb.com/images/2006/07/23/aWswIxSk.jpg" />I don’t know if any of you know this, but I’m a Padres fan.  Born and bred in sunny San Diego, California, I grew up listening to games on the radio, watching them on TV, and even going to games with my family.  I even have some souvenirs!  The bat that I usually keep by my front door as my sole theft deterrent was picked up as a home-game give-away way back in the early ’80s, back when they wore brown and gold.  Anyways, here in Vegas, Cox Cable, as a proud sponsor of the Friars, carries live game coverage for virtually every Padres game, unless it’s a national network blackout or a midweek day game.  So after living in towns where local coverage was always given to the Dodgers and the Giants, I now finally get to play catch-up and watch the Padres play all the time!<br /><br />It was a tough series against the Giants this weekend.  They lost 3 in a row, and last night’s loss resulted in them losing first place in the National League West, while the Giants Bogarted that title, for one day, anyway.  But this afternoon’s game was one to remember.  One of those edge-of-the seat nailbiters!  It took 12 innings, but they finally earned the victory, and moved back into the lead that they had successfully held on to all month until Saturday’s loss.  I’m so proud!  Here’s the <a href="http://sandiego.padres.mlb.com/images/2006/07/23/aWswIxSk.jpg">article</a> from padres.com.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <p>Kent Hughes may be a gifted teacher, but there are things to disagree with him about. One issue troubled me recently when I was reading his chapter on giving in <em>Disciplines of a Godly Man</em>. First, I’d like to say that I know that I give less than I should. But the only reason for that is that I believe it’s biblically less-than-ideal for me to have credit card debt, so I am putting more than half of my income towards remedying that situation, in order that I may be more free to give in the future.</p>

      <p>Just thought I should follow up on the computer upgrade progress, for those who seemed to be interested in what I was doing with it last year.  As I mentioned in my <a href="http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&amp;friendID=17285023&amp;blogID=116194105&amp;MyToken=f5ee37df-9cf9-4133-b738-177d3d11d1f8">MySpace blog</a> a couple of months ago, I had to replace the motherboard in my computer.  I replaced it with an <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16813131484">ASUS P4P800 SE</a> from NewEgg.com, which works excellently!  I had gone to Fry’s to get a new mobo because I considered it an emergency, only to find out when I got home that the one I picked wasn’t even compatible with my CPU, so I had to return it.  This one’s a perfect replacement, although you would need a larger ATX case like mine to hold it (for those of you trying to upgrade your Dell Dimension 2350).  The mobo has an AGP video slot, so I also got a new video card with dual monitor &amp; DVI capability.  I also replaced the power supply with a new one from Antec.  Replace the mobo also meant I had to buy a new copy of Windows to replace the OEM version.  Last winter I also added on a 120 GB hard drive to hold all my music.  So now there’s nothing Dell about it (except for my Dell LCD monitor, which I purchased separately because it was a great bargain).&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <h2><a href="/2006/07/14/wisdom-teeth-or-my-mouth-hurts-really-bad/">Wisdom Teeth, or My Mouth Hurts Really Bad</a></h2>
      <p>Well, I got my lower wisdom teeth removed yesterday.  It hurts so bad!!!  I had totally been looking forward to having the day off from work (I don’t get many of those), but I don’t think the trade-off is worth all the pain!  I’d much rather be performing monthly maintenance tasks on the company’s call collector database, or even—<em>gasp</em>—importing huge spreadsheets of e-mail addresses into the Smash Mag mailing list!<br /><br />Last night I watched the new <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> with my parents.  Being the manly man that I am, I tried to avoid it for such a long time!  But I suppose my curiosity was captured through the references in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0785263705/lbmusic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blue Like Jazz</a>, as well as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/6305368171/lbmusic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">You’ve Got Mail</a> (which isn’t a very manly-man type of film either).  Notwithstanding the fact that it’s easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than it is for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God, the film was actually quite good, and I gotta say Elizabeth Bennett’s an awesome chick!  However, I did get rather depressed by that whole, “Papa, we’re so similar”, thing.  I think the quest for a soulmate is easier when you just give up on it entirely, and it hurts less when you don’t expose yourself to such sentiments in film and literature.  But that’s a rather morbid attitude, and since I am never again going to date somebody with which I don’t have that kind of connection, I should make it clear that avoiding the soulmate idea for me does not mean replacing it with an anti-soulmate outlook.  Once, for a couple of months, I gave up on the soulmate thing and replaced it with a sort of pragmatic, go-with-the-flow outlook, and I must say it was the worst period of my life.  I believe in the Providence of God, and that he does have someone picked out for me who would match in that e-Harmony kind of way (which I don’t use, by the way), and I reject the teaching and opinions of those who say the opposite.   So when I say it’s easier to avoid it, I guess I mean it’s easier to not think about it (for example, by avoiding chick flicks and love songs), because all that does is bring depression.  I guess I have to just wait for God’s timing and remain available to whatever his plans are, waiting for him to point her out to me.<br /><br />One more observation: I gotta say that if it is at all possible, one should avoid having 5 daughters and no sons.  I know that sometimes such things cannot be avoided, but in such cases, one should hope for his daughters to be more like Elizabeth than the others, and one should stand up and be the man of the house and prevent the kind of meddlesomeness and shallowness expressed by the mother and other sisters.  Okay, that’s all I have to say about that.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <p>Anyone who’s seen me driving in my truck knows that I often like to leave the tailgate down when I’m driving.  My friends used to think I was crazy because of this.  Well, they were right.<br /><br />Something I saw on Mythbusters tonight (on the Discovery Channel) just totally blew me away.  They proved scientifically that driving a pickup with the tailgate down instead of up actually creates drag, while having the tailgate up REDUCES it!  My dad told me years ago that it was the other way around, and I believed him, intuitively.  It just made sense to me.  But they showed that with the tailgate up, a sort of “vortex bubble” is created in the bed of the truck, like a sort of invisible shell of air slowly moving in a circular motion, which forces the fast air you encounter when driving to go over the tailgate entirely, eliminating drag.  With the tailgate down, this bubble is gone, and the fast air is forced straight down onto the bed and gate, pushing the truck against the ground and creating drag.<br /><br />Who’d a thunk it?&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;<img width="1" height="1" src="" alt="" />&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <p>So, I’m sorry I haven’t updated this blog in such a long time (although I have posted a couple entries on my <a href="http://www.myspace.com/fiddler56">MySpace</a>).  I’m finding that the MovableType platform doesn’t really meet my needs the way it’s set up, so I’m going to be working on programming my own blog in .NET and converting the database for the blog over to the new one once that’s ready.<br /><br />After 12 years away, I moved back to Las Vegas last week to start a new job, which began on Monday.  I’m very excited about it.  The Lord’s totally blessed me, and after the way the last 4 months have gone since Calvary Chapel Chico “let [me] go”, it’s really good to see His hand at work in bringing me to the place where He wants me.<br /><br />If you still read this, please comment to let me know!<br /><br />My dad got me Derek Webb’s album <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00008NGAS/lbmusic">“She Must and Shall Go Free”</a> for my birthday, and it finally arrived the other day.  I’ve admired this album from afar for quite a while.  Pat or Kevin had often left a copy at the sound booth, and I saw an online video of a Donald Miller message where he used the song “Wedding Dress”, playing over a video clip from Baz Lurman’s <i>Romeo &amp; Juliet</i>, as a sort of worship-facilitator to bring his message home. (I downloaded that song from iTunes a few weeks ago so I could have it, but that was before I knew I was going to get the whole album.)<br /><br />I must say I’ve never been one to listen to Caedmon’s Call.  But this album is really special.  Most of the songs deal with who we are as the Church, the Bride of Christ, and the price our Groom paid to redeem us.  A lot of the songs include imagery (especially “Wedding Dress”) that pulls from the recurring theme found in Scripture and most graphically portrayed in the book of Hosea: We are all whores; the Church is one big Whore; but our Husband has laid it all on the line to come find us and bring us home and clean us up.<br /><br />It looks like Derek’s going to have a new album out in a couple weeks, so be sure to watch for it!&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;<img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2602771351651662379-4172702442341363139?l=mustfollow.blogspot.com" alt="" />&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <p>The church is a body made up of people.  My mom once said to me, tongue-in-cheek, “Church would be perfect if it weren’t for the people.”  But if you didn’t have people, you wouldn’t have the church.  How do we reconcile the need to function as a viable part of the social church with the need for an individual one-on-one relationship with God, one which must supercede all other relationships and attachments in our lives?<br /><br />“But Jesus on his part did not entrust himself to them, because he knew all people and needed no one to bear witness about man, for he himself knew what was in man” (John 2:24-25, ESV).<br /><br />Oswald Chambers made some important comments on these verses, and I have found them rather helpful.<br /><br />First, on page 152 of <i>My Utmost for His Highest</i>, He says,<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;<b>Put God First in Trust.</b> Our Lord trusted no man; yet He was never suspicious, never bitter, never in despair about any man, because He put God first in trust; He trusted absolutely in what God’s grace could do for any man.  If I put my trust in human beings first, I will end in despairing of everyone; I will become bitter, because I have insisted on man being what no man ever can be–absolutely right.  Never trust anything but the grace of God in yourself or in anyone else.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Man will let us down.  And we will become disillusioned.  Worse still, we become bitter when we continually look to imperfect people and are continually disappointed by them.  And bitterness is a perpetual state that colors our lives for a long time until we finally find healing and get rid of it.  But God is faithful.  “And I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ” (Phil. 1:6, ESV).<br /><br />On p. 212, Chambers discusses disillusionment, but he treats it as something we <i>need</i> rather than something to avoid!  (The header for this section is “The Discipline of Disillusionment”.)<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;Disillusionment means that there are no more false judgments in life.  To be undeceived by disillusionment may leave us cynical and unkindly severe in our judgment of others, but the disillusionment which comes from God brings us to the place where we see men and women as they really are, and yet there is no cynicism, we have no stinging, bitter things to say.  Many of the cruel things in life spring from the fact that we suffer from illusions.  We are not tru to one another as <i>facts</i>; we are true only to our <i>ideas</i> of one another.  Everything is either delightful and fine, or mean and dastardly, according to our idea.<br /><br />The refusal to be disillusioned is the cause of much of the suffering in human life.  It works in this way–if we love a human being and do not love God, we demand of him every perfection and every rectitude, and when we do not get it we become cruel and vindictive; we are demanding of a human being that which he or she cannot give.  There is only one Being Who can satisfy the last aching abyss of the human heart, and that is the Lord Jesus Christ.  Why Our Lord is apparently so severe regarding every human relationship is because He knows that every relationship not based on loyalty to Himself will end in disaster.  Our Lord trusted no man, yet He was never suspicious, never bitter.  Our Lord’s confidence in God and in what His grace could do for any man, was so perfect that He despaired of no one.  If our trust is placed in human beings, we shall end in despairing of everyone.&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br />&lt;table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" class="blogContentInfo"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr valign="top"&gt;    &lt;td&gt;<img border="0" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B000001DTM.01.THUMBZZZ.jpg" />&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Currently listening:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000001DTM/lbmusic" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Achtung Baby</strong></a><br /><br />By U2<br /><br />Release date: By 19 November, 1991<br /><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=myspace08-20&amp;l=xm2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000001DTM" width="1" />&lt;/td&gt;         &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;<img width="1" height="1" src="" alt="" />&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <p>Like many people, I’ve been blown away by the magnitude of what happened a week ago on the gulf coast.  I have been hesitant to put up links to donate to charities because I’m broke at the moment and unable to give myself, and I’d rather lead by example.  But we should all be in prayer for all of the people who were affected, and do whatever we can to help.  I heard a story about a guy from San Diego who chartered a huge passenger jet and brought back a dozen displaced families to live with people who had opened up their homes in California.<br /><br />Someone told me that the pastor at the church I used to attend said that God had nothing to do with Katrina.  But Amos 3:6 says: “Does disaster come to a city, unless the Lord has done it?”  God is in control.  I’m not saying that any of those people deserved what happened to them more than the rest of us did.  What I’m saying is: all of us deserved it.  Look at what Jesus said:<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;There were some present at that very time who told him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices. And he answered them, “Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans, because they suffered in this way? No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish. Or those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them: do you think that they were worse offenders than all the others who lived in Jerusalem? No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish.” Luke 13:1-5 (ESV)&lt;/blockquote&gt;The garden of Eden was a safe place.  No disasters.  No death.  But when Adam and Eve sinned, the Lord removed them from the garden and placed them in a very dangerous world.  Since the fall of man, and due to original sin, we are all deserving of death, and it’s only by God’s grace and mercy than any of us continue to breathe each minute.<br /><br />Everyone should check out this article by John Piper called <a href="http://desiringgod.org/library/fresh_words/2005/090205.html">“Was Katrina Intelligent Design?”</a>.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;<img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2602771351651662379-2198889591861312883?l=mustfollow.blogspot.com" alt="" />&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <p>I got hired today at <a href="http://www.travidia.com/">Travidia</a>.  I’m not working in the run-off-press pits, which is where, I found out last night, a bunch of people I know are now working.  The supervisor decided to place me in Special Sections, a day shift in the airport office, so I can be closer to the designers, programmers and developers and get my foot in the door with them.  He also had the receptionist make sure and forward my letters and résumé to the human resources director so she can consider me for a developer position.  The coolest thing about this company is that it uses ASP.NET and SQL Server for all of its data entry and website stuff, so even if I’m not working in those areas, I told them during the interview, it’s still like I’m part of the same clan because I’ve been working with that technology for 7 years.  Cool, huh?  It’s an entry-level position, but supposedly it’s a great company to work for because they elevate you quickly.  Plus, if they decide to hire me as a developer, then I’ll be making even more, right away.  At least it’s something to have while I look for something better.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;<img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2602771351651662379-8779965215266505074?l=mustfollow.blogspot.com" alt="" />&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <p>Quote:<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;Be it for the praise of other Christians, or just to get them off your back, the desire to have people praise your progress in the faith can be just as vain as the need to be seen as a success by your peers, or society, or any of those other forms of “acceptable” ego-stroking. Since the very essence of God’s grace is that He has given us unmerited mercy in return for our wickedness, ego should have nothing to do with our growth as Christians. I believe that taking pride in driving a better car or having a nicer house than your neighbor is no less a matter of pride as the desire to hear other Christians praise your so-called godliness. While it’s good to encourage others by maturing in your faith, just as the spiritual maturity of those around us is encouraging, it’s also easy to get off track. I’m talking about that need for a spiritual “Atta-boy!” or a better seat in church on Sunday, or the always dangerous acceptance into that inner circle of “church staff.” (No, I don’t think that the position of a church staff member is evil. I just know that if Christianity is treated like a social club, it often has the same entanglements as one. From someone who spent half of his life growing up in churches, I can say it happens, and more often than you might think.) - Mark Salomon, <i>Simplicity</i>&lt;/blockquote&gt;I am no longer on church staff.  Please pray for me.  As far as my heart goes, He has been preparing me for this.  I can totally see his hand in it, but I was just expecting him to have things all lined up before he pulled the rug out from under me.  Pray that God will return me to successful independent-contractorship and bring me some clients, and pray that he would lead me where to go from here in terms of ministry and church community, etc.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;<img width="1" height="1" src="" alt="" />&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <p>I’m between DSL services at the moment.  The one we had was turned off, and the new one we’re getting has not been turned on yet.  But lately some people have been preaching to me about the supposed unethical nature of sharing internet access with Wi-Fi.  They say it’s the same thing as stealing cable.<br /><br />The thing is, though, it <i>is</i> illegal to steal cable.  It’s <i>not</i> illegal, however, to leave your Wi-Fi network open without password-protection so that others can use it.  There are no laws against it; the phone company actually provides wireless routers in order to <i>encourage</i> Wi-Fi networking.  In fact, <a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2109941">this article on Slate</a> goes so far as to say that if even if you do have a password for your network but you’re using one that’s easily guessable, then it’s still not illegal because there’s no law against guessing someone’s password when they make it so easy.  What <i>is</i> illegal is cracking someone’s encryption and going on their hard drive (without their permission, I mean… your friends have the right to give you access to their shared files if they want to), but using their router to go online is not.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there are no usable networks accessible from our apartment but our own, so it makes it a moot point.  Juno was giving me about 1,000 popups a minute (okay, slight exaggeration), so I’m using a free 5-hour trial period of ad-free pre-paid <a href="http://www.budgetdialup.com/">Budget Dialup</a>, which is super handy for when you’re between DSL hookups.

For those whom he foreknew he also <i>predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son</i>…” Rom 8:28-29 (ESV) (emphasis mine).<br /><br />I am currently reading a book by Paul David Tripp called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0875526047/lbmusic"><i>War of Words</i></a>, published by P&amp;R.  To say it’s really good would be an understatement.<br /><br />Chapter 5 is all about how the root of all of our communication breakdowns (complaining, arguing, manipulating, criticizing, etc.) is a fundamental lack of trust in God’s sovereignty.<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;…a life of godly communication is rooted in a personal recognition of the sovereignty of God.  Let me put it this way:  Only when I submit to the rule of God, who has a <i>perfect plan</i> and is in <i>complete control</i>, will I begin to live and speak as he has purposed.  Only at this level will the idolatry of heart that leads to idol [<i>sic</i>] words be broken.  Here alone will my words be freed from being the tools of <i>my</i> agenda, <i>my</i> attempts at control, and <i>my</i> glory-seeking.<br /><br />When my heart is more controlled by a desire for the creation (a person, possession, position, or experience) than it is by a desire for the Creator, I will seek to control my world (and the people in it) to get what I want….None rests in God’s sovereignty, believing that he will give what is best. (p. 69)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;…the roots of biblical communication grow in the soil of his sovereignty.  If my words don’t flow out of a heart that rests in his control, then they come out of a heart that seeks control, so I can get what I want.  I need a better understanding of what God is doing. (p. 71)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;When I know that God is in control of my life, I do not give in to panic.  I do not begin thinking that life is out of control, and I do not despair when I am confused about what is going on.  I know that every situation is under the careful administration of the King of Kings. (p. 72)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;God is sovereign over the circumstances of our lives, but Scripture says more.  It tells us that these circumstances are a principal means by which God actually produces what he predestined for our lives before the foundation of the world–that we would be transformed into the likeness of his Son, holy as he his holy.<br /><br />When we complain about the problems and pressures in our lives, we are essentially grumbling in the face of God.  We are complaining that we have been chosen by his love and grace, and that he is putting us in situations designed to make us his holy people!  These relationships and circumstances, these problems and trials, and these times of grief and suffering come from his hand.  They are tokens of God’s wonderful grace, given to deliver us from the power of remaining sin!  Behind the circumstances is a God of love who is relentlessly at work to make us holy.  Praise that comes from hearts of worship is the only legitimate response to these circumstances.  Rather than telling us that God has forgotten us, our circumstances shout to us that he has remembered us and will not leave us until his work is complete!  Really understanding this will do much to alter the way we talk. (p. 77)&lt;/blockquote&gt;This is all good stuff on it’s own.  But Tripp takes it further with a discussion of why theology itself is so important.  You can’t just go to the scriptures that tell you what to do.  You have to understand the whole of Scripture to see God’s reason behind those commands.<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;God’s will is that all of our speaking be done for the praise of <i>his</i> glory [see Eph. 1]–an exciting new agenda very different from our own.  For this reason it is important to understand what the Bible teaches about God’s sovereignty.  It is the cornerstone for a new agenda for our words.<br /><br />In talking about this doctrine, I know that I am raising thorny issues that go beyond the scope of typical communication discussions….We live in a church culture that tends to separate biblical commands and principles from the rest of Scripture.  We look at specific verses about communication and seek to apply them to our lives without understanding the way they are rooted in the history and theology of Scripture.  We miss the big picture–the way the rest of Scripture gives these commands their meaning and rationale.  The commands and principles of Scripture flow from the theology of Scripture.  More than that, they find their hope and meaning in the person and work of Christ.<br /><br />For example, the only reason it makes sense to do good to your enemies is that the One who has told us to is a God of perfect justice.  The call to forgive is rooted in the fact that Christ has forgiven us.  The call to give sacrificially is rooted in God’s promise to provide for all our needs.  Every command and principle has its roots in redemptive realities–what God has done and will do for us in Christ.  This is theology–but it’s certainly not abstract information!  Scripture is full of theology because when you undestand truth about God, you understand <i>why</i> and <i>how</i> you are to carry out the commands of Scripture.  You understand how your actions connect with what God is doing, and how you can actually bring glory to his name. (pp. 70-71)&lt;/blockquote&gt;When I was a kid, whenever my parents would tell me to do something, I would always want to know why.  I needed to know the reason behind it, that there was some purpose, some greater meaning to it all.  Unfortunately, the answer was usually, “Because I said so.”  Granted, that is all that should be required of obedience.  But one of the coolest things about this understanding of theology is that it shows us that God is not like the parent who says, “Because I said so.”  Yes, his purpose is to teach us his character–that we might know him–to get us to the place where we will stop complaining and always do what he wants without questioning, but he wants us to truly have an understanding of his goodness and faithfulness.  He doesn’t just want to keep us as little children; he wants to raise us up as heirs.<br /><br />In Exodus 14, when the Israelites were trapped by the Red Sea, they started complaining.  But God had a purpose in it.  “Notice that this trial produced <i>exactly</i> what God had planned for his people.  ‘And when the Israelites saw the great power the LORD displayed against the Egyptians, the people feared the LORD and put their trust in him and in Moses his servant’ [Ex. 14:31 (NIV)]” (Tripp, p. 80).<br /><br />This happened over and over again in Israel’s history.  Each time, God wills their being put in a situation where they complain, with his purpose being precisely to teach them not to complain the next time the same thing happens.<br /><br />It’s not just a problem that laypeople face.  Look at Elijah–I just read 1 Kings 18 this morning.  But what does Elijah say in 19:4? “It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life, for I am no better than my fathers” (ESV).  He’s completely given up on God’s will in his life, even after the power God evidenced through him on Mt. Carmel and the euphoria of slaughtering 450 bad guys!<br /><br />Let us <i>rest</i> in his sovereign arms (Jason, Piña, are your reading this?).  We don’t have to have everything figured out, but we need to continually remember that we are not the lords of our own domain.  God himself is in charge, and there’s a point to what he’s doing: redemption and sanctification.  It’s really not about what we want.  It’s about glorifying him while we watch him work his will in our lives and make us the men and women of God that he wants us to be.<br /><br /><i>Lord, help me to trust in you.  Give me the grace to get through these times.  Take control of my heart and my mind in order that you might continually intervene in my thoughts and remind me that you are in control.  Help me, Lord to submit to your will for my life, and to seek your glory above all.  And please forgive me, Father, for those times when I have sought to take the reigns for myself, only to wind up in the mud.</i><br /><br />“Now I’m riding in the back seat, and I’m leaving all the driving to the Chief.” - Dallas Holm&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;<img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2602771351651662379-5066209256802934628?l=mustfollow.blogspot.com" alt="" />&lt;/div&gt;</p>

<blockquote>O God, quicken to life every power within me, that I may lay hold on eternal things.  Open my eyes that I may see; give me acute spiritual perception; enable me to taste Thee and know that Thou art good.  Make heaven more real to me than any earthly thing has ever been.  Amen. (Tozer, <i>The Pursuit of God</i>, 59)</blockquote>
<blockquote>But why do the very ransomed children of God themselves know so little of that habitual, conscious communion with God which Scripture offers?  The answer is because of our chronic unbelief.  Faith enables our spiritual sense to function.  Where faith is defective the result will be inward insensibility and numbness toward spiritual things.  (Tozer, 52)</blockquote>
<p>This faith isn’t the same thing as what faith-healers keep telling us we are lacking.  That “faith” is actually imagination, “positive thinking”, daydreaming, usually based on what we want.  No, real faith–belief that what God says is true, belief that the spiritual kingdom of heaven is real even though we can’t see it–is based on the One Absolute reality, the fact that God is God, and He would be who He is apart from my recognition.  It’s not one of those “if a tree falls in the woods and no one is there to hear it, does it make a sound?”–  No, God is real, and he is speaking, and if we can’t hear the tree fall it’s because we’re spiritually deaf.<br /><br />Faith lives with a conscious acknowledgment of the spiritual realities.  All my life I have lived with attention to the spiritual, but unfortunately I think most of that attention has been given to the imaginary rather than the real.<br /><br />For example, life is not all about me.  The reality of God is so much bigger than little old me.  His ways are higher, and His purpose so much more vast.  Yet I think on the way to the knowledge of God as personal (and He <i>is</i> a personal God), and the realization that He actually cares about us, it is possible for us to develop a pattern of faith whereby our faith is based on what we want God to do for us.  This type of faith is a faith that concerns itself with improving quality of life, “finding my place,” being vindicated against my unjust enemies, and so on.  I think my faith can so often become self-centered in this manner.  I know I’ve prayed for God to heal my knee (and I’ve seen another person go forward to get prayer for 20/20 vision so he wouldn’t have to wear contacts when he surfs…).<br /><br />While I do believe God concerns himself with our daily lives, I think living a lifestyle where our faith seeks what we can get out of it rather than where our faith seeks to know more and more of God’s character, is kind of a one-sided relationship, don’t you?<br /><br /><i>The Pursuit of God</i> is all about experiencing God personally, but we have to make sure that we’re submitting our minds to Christ, so that this experience is based on Reality and not imagination.<br /><br />~May 7, 2005, Brown’s Hole, Chico&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;<img width="1" height="1" src="" alt="" />&lt;/div&gt;</p>

It only took me four days to read it, and I can’t remember the last time I was so engulfed in a book.  I’ve been a fan of Stavesacre and The Crucified since 1996, when I made it a habit of picking up anything in the Tooth &amp; Nail catalog, and driving all over So-Cal to see Christian punk, ska, and hardcore shows from bands like the Supertones, Value Pac, MxPx, Slick Shoes, EDL…  I could go on, but I think my favorite shows were always the Stavesacre shows.  Mark’s book was written to tear down the image that has been set up by Christian music industry in order to take advantage of the “Christian market” (the word that industry uses to refer to God’s people, the Body of Christ).  This task of unmasking the crooked machine requires some serious rethinking of the way things have been, and also some harsh tactics of looking reality straight in the face and admitting some serious personal failures that occurred even while Mark was hiding behind the mask of “Christian rock star” in the late eighties and early nineties.  God took him through a period of serious humbling at the end of The Crucified, revealing to him just how much he was in need of Grace.  Sometimes for kids who grow up in the church, knowing the Lord, the only way the Lord can remove their own self-righteousness and pride is to let them fall… hard.  Since then, Mark was restored to music again with Stavesacre, and now with this book, he has a message to bring to the world: Worship the Lord with all your heart, soul, and strength, love your neighbor as yourself.  Take off your masks, stop judging others, be real and pursue truth and humility in the way we live our lives towards believers and unbelievers, so that we can more effectively reflect Christ to those who are watching.  I still need some time to digest it before I write a full-on review, but <a href="http://www.christianbook.com/Christian/Books/product_slideshow?sku=035766&amp;actual_sku=035766&amp;slide=1">this excerpt</a> will give you guys a perfect taste of what the book is all about.<br /><br />I’m not the first to say it, but the book goes well with Charlie Peacock’s <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.blogger.com/www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0877881286/lbmusic"><i>At the Crossroads</i></span>, which deconstructs the industry from a producer’s perspective, and describes all the different ways that musicians can glorify God with the gifts he’s given them, within the church and without (the kingdom of God is actually bigger than this universe, not a small subset of it).&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <h2><a href="/2005/04/27/removing-the-veil/">&quot;Removing the Veil&quot;</a></h2>
      <p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">DISCLAIMER:</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> This blog was written before I became a 5-point Calvinist.  In this blog entry I quoted A.W. Tozer saying, “it is what the cross would do to every man to set him free.”  Tozer is an Arminian and therefore believes that the atonement is not limited to the elect, but that the cross “would” set every man free if only they make the free-will choice to come to God.<br /><br />Original entry:<br /></span><br />John Piper says, “The chief end of man is to glorify God by enjoying Him forever.”  But the capacity for this manner of enjoyment is something impossible for man in our fallen state.  Our grandfather Adam has planted in all of us a tendency to shy away from the presence of God.  The flesh strives against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh.<br /><br />Though it is impossible for a sinful being to survive in the Presence of God, yet it is our purpose to live in the Presence.  This is the significance of Mark 15:38: “And the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom” (ESV).  It was God’s initiative that tore the veil.  And it was Christ’s sacrifice which enables us to enter the Presence.<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;Therefore, brothers, since we have confidence to enter the holy places by the blood of Jesus, by the new and living way that he opened for us through the curtain, that is, through his flesh, and since we have a great priest over the house of God, let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, with our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water. (Heb 10:19-22, ESV)&lt;/blockquote&gt;Because Christ is our high priest, we can have “full assurance of faith.”  And not only that, but we have the evidence of the Spirit.  “For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, ‘Abba! Father!’ The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God” (Rom 8:15-16, ESV).  What son doesn’t know he has been adopted?  (Moby, who doesn’t think a Christian can really know he’s saved, needs to read these passages.)<br /><br />A.W. Tozer writes,<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;Everything in the New Testament accords with this Old Testament picture.  Ransomed men need no longer pause in fear to enter the Holy of Holies.  <i>God wills that we should push on into His presence and live our whole life there.</i>  This is to be known to us in conscious experience.  It is more than a doctrine to be held; it is a life to be enjoyed every moment of every day.  (<i>The Pursuit of God</i>, 36)&lt;/blockquote&gt;Is this the abundant life that Jesus came to give us?  And can we really experience it for ourselves while we’re still walking in this case of meat?<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;At the heart of the Christian message is God Himself waiting for His redeemed children to push in to conscious awareness of His presence.  That type of Christianity which happens now to be the vogue knows this Presence only in theory.  It fails to stress the Christian’s privilege of present realization.  According to its teachings we are in the presence of God positionally, and nothing is said about the need to experience that Presence actually…Ignoble contentment takes the place of burning zeal.  We are satisfied to rest in our judicial possessions and, for the most part, we bother ourselves very little about the absence of personal experience.  (37)&lt;/blockquote&gt;Children, if we are doubting our adoption, it’s because we haven’t known the Father’s Presence.  And the Presence is something we’re supposed to know.<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;…the scribe tells us what he has read, and the prophet tells what he has seen.  The distinction is not an imaginary one.  Between the scribe who has read and the prophet who has seen there is a difference as wide as the sea.  We are overrun today with orthodox scribes, but the prophets, where are they?  The hard voice of the scribe sounds over evangelicalism, but the church waits for the tender voice of the saint who has penetrated the veil and has gazed with inward eye upon the wonder that is God.  And yet, thus to penetrate, to push in sensitive living experience into the holy Presence, is a privilege open to every child of God.  (43)&lt;/blockquote&gt;Tozer says that there is a veil in our hearts which separates us from the Presence of God today, and it is the veil of Self.<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;It is woven of the fine threads of the self-life, the hyphenated sins of the human spirit.  They are not something we <i>do</i>, they are something we <i>are</i>, and therein lies both their subtlety and their power.<br /><br />To be specific, the self-sins are self-righteousness, self-pity, self-confidence, self-sufficiency, self-admiration, self-love and a host of others like them.  They dwell too deep within us and are too much a part of our natures to come to our attention till the light of God is focused upon them.  The grosser manifestations of these sins–egotism, exhibitionism, self-promotion–are strangely tolerated in Christian leaders, even in circles of impeccable orthodoxy.  They are so much in evidence as actually, for many people, to become identified with the gospel. (45)&lt;/blockquote&gt;But this veil is so much a part of us, that it can “be removed only in spiritual experience, never by mere instruction.  We may as well try to instruct leprosy out of our system” (46).  Only God can rend the veil.<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;In human experience that veil is made of living spiritual tissue; it is composed of the sentient, quivering stuff of which our whole beings consist, and to touch it is to touch us where we feel pain.  To tear it away is to injure us, to hurt us and make us bleed.  To say otherwise is to make the cross no cross and death no death at all.  It is never fun to die.  To rip through the dear and tender stuff of which life is made can never be anything but deeply painful.  Yet that is what the cross did to Jesus and it is what the cross would do to every man to set him free.&lt;/blockquote&gt;There can be no self-surgery here.  Only our Divine Physician can handle this scalpel.  And as John Owen says, we must beware of using our reasoning and rationalization to produce our own peace when the Holy Spirit has not pronounced such a peace for our souls.  We must let Him work in our hearts and have His way in us.<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;Search me, O God, and know my heart;<br />test me and know my anxious thoughts.<br /><br />See if there is any offensive way in me,<br />and lead me in the way everlasting. (Psalm 139:23-24, NIV)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;<i>Within the veil<br />I now would come<br />Within the Holy Place<br />To look upon Thy face<br />I see such Beauty there<br />None other can compare<br />I worship Thee, my Lord<br />Within the veil</i> (Ruth Dryden, © 1978 Genesis Music)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;<img width="1" height="1" src="" alt="" />&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <h2><a href="/2005/04/25/as-unto-the-lord/">As Unto the Lord&#8230;</a></h2>
      <p>I just read something in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1581342861/lbmusic"><i>Disciplines of a Godly Man</i></a> that goes along perfectly with what Pastor Sam <a href="http://www.calvarychapel.com/chico/library/allen-sam/studies-books/52-1th-2005/52-1th-004-001.wma">said yesterday</a> about 1 Thessalonians 4:11b-12a–“…work with your own hands, as we commanded you, that you may walk properly toward those who are outside…” (NKJV).  Kent Hughes makes an important point, although most of this excerpt is him quoting someone else:<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;Lastly, our work must be done with an eye to excellence.  Dorothy Sayers said that the Church in our time <br />&lt;blockquote&gt;has forgotten that the secular vocation is sacred.  Forgotten that a building must be good architecture before it can be a good church; that a painting must be well painted before it can be a good sacred picture; that work must be good work before it can call itself God’s work.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Work that is truly Christian is work well done.<br /><br />Genesis 1 logs God’s commitment to excellence when it says, “God saw all that he had made, and it was very good” (v. 31).  Christians should always do good work.  Christians ought to be the <i>best</i> workers wherever they are.  They ought to have the <i>best</i> attitude, the <i>best</i> integrity, and be the <i>best</i> in dependability. (R. Kent Hughes, <i>Disciplines of a Godly Man</i>, p. 154)&lt;/blockquote&gt;I’ve grown up knowing that everything I do is <i>supposed</i> to be as unto the Lord.  This should be true of all Christians, not just the ones who grow up going to a Calvary Chapel with parents who are in ministry and who sit in the main service because the 6th grade teaching is too “milky”.  But I know that not all of us live like this.  (Plus, I know it’s easier to grow up knowing what you’re supposed to do than it is to maintain that practice when you grow up and enter the “real world”.)<br /><br />But what struck me most about this passage is the way the first part relates it to Church life, not just our vocation.  “A painting must be well painted before it can be a good sacred picture,” says Dorothy Sayers.<br /><br />What if it said, “Music must be good music before it can be worship music?”  What if it said, “Music must be playable on a secular radio station before we can consider its lyrical content for qualification  for airplay on K-Love or Air One?”<br /><br />What if all Christian movies were as well-made as <i>The Passion</i>?  And what if Protestant filmmakers were as good as the Catholics?  What would the world look like?<br /><br />I read today about the high-church “Oxford movement” of the 19th century, when Anglicans like John Henry Newman tried to steer the Church of England closer to the Church of Rome.  An important part of their worship was that singers in the choirs had vocal training.<br /><br />The biggest problem with high-church thinking is that it’s all outward.  Whitewashed tombs, Jesus would say.  Musicians would be hired solely for their skills, with no consideration given to an evidence of a walk with the Lord or the presence of spiritual gifts.  When I was in college, I was often hired to play with a string quartet at the Episcopal church in Malibu because I knew the music director, and she knew I needed the money.  And I’m not even baptized into the Church of England!  And I also know that my grandparents’ church in Garden Grove has a Local-47 union house orchestra.  Because the words that are being sung contain certain words, no consideration is given to the theology or lifestyle of the people singing them or playing the underlying chords.<br /><br />In Luther’s time, the Church of Rome financed its building projects with the sale of indulgences to the masses, exploiting both princes and paupers.  And even a <a href="http://www.chiesa.espressonline.it/dettaglio.jsp?id=7023&amp;eng=y">recent building project</a> was outsourced to a Jewish architect.  When asked how he felt about being the first Jewish architect in history to design a church for the Roman Catholic Church, Richard Meier answered,<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;I feel extremely proud. It is very clear that the Catholic Church chose my design based on its merits, not because of a need to make a statement in regard to their relationship to Jews throughout history. Three of the architects in the competition were Jewish. They were chosen to compete because they were among the top architects of our time. However, I think it is important that there is communication and mutual admiration and respect between members of all faiths. As the architect of this church, some might say that I am, to some degree, a symbolic bridge between faiths. (source: <a href="http://www.wirednewyork.com/forum/archive/index.php?t-4168.html"><i>Wired New York</i></a>)&lt;/blockquote&gt;Christian art isn’t the world’s art paid for by the Church’s dollars.  There has to be something different, somewhere between the Catholic church’s extreme art production methods where their end justifies their means, and the Puritan removal of all art from the sanctuary (even to the extreme of the Church of Christ removing musical instruments altogether).<br /><br />So, what I mean when I ask, <i>What would the world look like?</i> is: <i>What would it look like if the Church</i> (and I am speaking of the real body of believers, not the corrupted age-old institutions) <i>could raise up this kind of quality from the inside without having to hire or outsource its art and music?</i>  What if people serving at their church saw their service as a holy sacrifice unto the Lord rather than merely “volunteer duty”?  What if people on the worship team practiced as much as people who play in the pubs?  What if non-Christians actually flocked to Christian “outreach concerts” because they heard the artists on the radio, and the quality of their music surpassed all the other songs on the station’s playlist?  And what if, after the world pounded down our doors to get in, we didn’t have to water down the truth of the Word of God in order to prevent them from leaving?<br /><br />What if we all gave of our time and our talents and our money to the local body of believers where God has placed us, and in this giving we really believed that the gifts were unto God?  What if we didn’t need a tax-deductible receipt or a pat on the back or a word of praise from our fellow man in order to feel like our gift wasn’t in vain?<br /><br />I want to leave you with a passage from Exodus 36 that deals with both of these issues.  The first part speaks of excellence in craftsmanship and artistry, and it’s a statement about the creative gifts God gave mankind when he made us <i>in his image</i>, and how these gifts need to be excercised as unto the Lord.  The last part deals with excellence and extravagance in monetary giving.<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;Bezalel and Oholiab and every craftsman in whom the LORD has put skill and intelligence to know how to do any work in the construction of the sanctuary shall work in accordance with all that the LORD has commanded.<br /><br />And Moses called Bezalel and Oholiab and every craftsman in whose mind the LORD had put skill, everyone whose heart stirred him up to come to do the work. And they received from Moses all the contribution that the people of Israel had brought for doing the work on the sanctuary. They still kept bringing him freewill offerings every morning, so that all the craftsmen who were doing every sort of task on the sanctuary came, each from the task that he was doing, and said to Moses, “The people bring much more than enough for doing the work that the LORD has commanded us to do.” So Moses gave command, and word was proclaimed throughout the camp, “Let no man or woman do anything more for the contribution for the sanctuary.” So the people were restrained from bringing, for the material they had was sufficient to do all the work, and more. (Exodus 36:1-7, ESV)&lt;/blockquote&gt;What if?&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <h2><a href="/2005/04/15/spiritual-bankruptcy/">Spiritual Bankruptcy</a></h2>
      <blockquote>David departed from there and escaped to the cave of Adullam.  And when his brothers and all his father's house heard it, they went down there to him.  And everyone who was in distress, and everyone who was in debt, and everyone who was bitter in soul, gathered to him.  And he became captain over them. (1 Sam 22:1-2, ESV)</blockquote>
<blockquote>As Jesus passed on from there, he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax booth, and he said to him, "follow me."  And he rose and followed him.<br /><br />And as Jesus reclined at table in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and were reclining with Jesus and his disciples.  And when the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"  But when he heard it, he said, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick.  But go and learn what this means, 'I desire mercy, and not sacrifice.'  For I came not to call the righteous, but sinners."  (Mt 9:9-13, ESV)</blockquote>
<p>I know what it is to be in debt.  I also know why it’s bad to be in debt.  But I also know that Jesus’ eternal values differ from our temporal ones.  The American ideals of self-sufficiency and independence are what make it so hard for so many people in this country to come to Christ.  They say, “I don’t need your crutch, I can do it on my own.”  But the debtors, the disenfranchised, the disillusioned, the broken, those are the ones who know they can’t do it on their own.  They know, like Paul, that “nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh.  For I have the desire to do what is right, but not the ability to carry it out” (Rom 7:18, ESV).<br /><br />He put no confidence in the flesh, though this is the same guy who said in Philippians 3 that he had reason to boast in the flesh.  Christ brought him to the end of himself and destroyed his self-confidence.  The acknowledgment of our own spiritual bankruptcy is the most crucial step in coming into a life of surrender to Christ.  This is the meaning of Hosea 6:6.<br /><br />Unlike temporal debts, our eternal debt can never be worked off.  Surrender is the only way.  We make ourselves bondservants to our loving Master, permanently, giving up all rights to our selves, “forever” (see Deut 15:12-18).  But then he calls us sons.<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;So then, brothers, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh. For if you live according to the flesh you will die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live. For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, “Abba! Father!” The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, then heirs–heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him.<br /><br />For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us. For the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the <b>sons of God</b>.  (Rom 8:12-19, ESV)&lt;/blockquote&gt;The covenant has been transgressed (Hosea 6:7), but the Father will restore our fortunes regardless (Hosea 6:11).  The inheritance which Adam squandered will be ours again, forever!&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;<img width="1" height="1" src="" alt="" />&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <h2><a href="/2005/04/12/my-sheep-hear-my-voice/">&#8216;My sheep hear my voice&#8217;</a></h2>
      <p>I am overjoyed at hearing about friends who have been receiving clear direction from the Lord lately.  There is a clear distinction between His voice, when we just KNOW it’s Him, and the ‘confirmation’ and ‘peace about it’ that we produce for ourselves through rationalization and reasoning—when we consult other people or search the Scriptures looking for self-justification in our corrupt situation rather than seeking the Holy Spirit’s illumination directly into our souls.  You can survey your friends and find ones who will take your side, and you can find promises in Scripture to help you feel better as you fight to have your own way, even though they are conditional on certain aspects of surrender which you are not meeting.  But when we are honest, and in communion with the Holy Spirit, he won’t let us deceive ourselves.  This voice is truth.  And we can hear it for ourselves.<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;…there is, if I may put it in this way, a secret instinct in faith, whereby it knows the voice of Christ when He truly speaks.  As the babe leaped in the womb when [Mary] came to Elisabeth, faith leaps in the heart when Christ indeed draws near.  ‘My sheep’, said Christ, ‘hear my voice’ (John 10:27).  ‘They know My voice; they are used to the sound of it.’ They know when His lips are opened to them and are full of grace.<br /><br />In the Song of Solomon (5:2), the bride knows the voice of her beloved.  As soon as he speaks she cries, ‘It is the voice of my beloved!’  She knew his voice and was so accustomed to communion with him that she instantly recognzied him.  So will you know the voice of Christ.  If you exercise yourselves to know and have fellowship with Him, you will easily discern between His voice and the voice of a stranger.<br /><br />Note this: When he speaks, he speaks as no man has ever spoken.  He speaks with power.  He will in one way or another make your heart burn within you (Luke 24).  When He puts his hand to the latch (Song of Sol. 5:4), His Spirit will seize your heart!<br /><br />Each one who has exercised himself to discern good and evil, and is increasing in judgment, experience, and observation to recognize Christ’s voice, and the operations of His Holy Spirit, is the best equipped to judge for himself when God is indeed speaking.

      <h2><a href="/2005/03/17/the-denominational-theory-of-the-church/">The Denominational Theory of the Church</a></h2>
      <p>Here is an excerpt from an e-mail I sent to a friend that I thought would make a good blog entry.<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;I read an interesting chapter in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0849938619/lbmusic?">Church History in Plain Language</a> about the denominational theory of the church.  It kind of threw everything I thought on its head.  Denomination comes from a root meaning ‘to give a name to’.  Basically, the theory says that we are all one body in Christ, who agree on the fundamentals of the faith, even though we are a bunch of groups with different names.  Unlike sectarianism, none of these groups—’denominations’—considers itself to be the sole possessors of the whole truth.  So, denominations are actually a good thing, and much less divisive than I grew up thinking.  It’s possible that to call oneself ‘non-denominational’ (according to the old definition) would have actually been a negative term, meaning that rather than recognizing the truth that other denominations might hold, we’re going to be our own exclusive group.  If you go by the old definition of denominationalism, than to call yourself non-denominational means you’re sectarian, exclusive, and divisive, whereas to be a denomination you are recognizing the worldwide unity of the brethren, and the fact that the church is made up of believers, not registered members.  Unfortunately, the definition has changed, so that people who grow up in ‘denominational’ churches today wonder why they have to be part of that denomination.  “Why don’t we just call ourselves Christian?” they ask.  And so they go and start non-denominational churches, and you can miss the whole point of denominational theory if you grow up thinking Presbyterians and Baptists and Methodists are sectarian, like saying “I follow Paul” or “I follow Apollos”.  Scripturally, that’s the closest parallel we have, and so if we look only at the Biblical truth without considering the context of church history, we can be missing something important.  We who preach such things today do so only because we’re not aware of the history of the wars that ravaged Europe for 100 years while they tried to settle religious differences along political boundary lines.  Originally, denominations arose out of the idea that it’s okay to let your neighbor have a different stance on a certain non-fundamental<br />doctrine than you carry, as long as they agree on the main points.  Now, in America, it’s evolved into pluralism, but it used to be about unity in the fundamentals.&lt;/blockquote&gt;I’m not saying that it’s wrong for us to be non-denominational, or that it’s wrong to be denominational (which I used to think).  I just think it’s important to get a context of our current church situation from Church History.  Denominations were the way that the church avoided continuing massive bloodshed after the age of the Reformation.  As Bruce Shelley says, “The denominational form of the church has marked the recent centuries of Christian history, not because it is ideal, but because it is better than any alternative the years have offered.”  No longer do we kill those we disagree with, so perhaps a greater unity in the church, outside the labels of denominations or ‘non-denominations’, is a greater possibility in the church today.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <p>A couple weeks ago my friend J.B. was diagnosed with cancer.  Prior to his diagnosis, someone from church had a ‘word’ for him that he was supposed to start journaling, but that this journal wasn’t for himself, but it was to bless other people and help them through their issues.  So he started <a href="http://www.inspiritandintruth.net/">blogging</a>.  His blog truly is a blessing, as he gets on there every day and updates everybody on what God’s teaching him as he goes through the motions with hospital visits, exams, CT scans, etc.<br /><br />This guy is a true bro, sent by God as a ‘son of encouragement’, just like Barnabas.  If it wasn’t for certain truths that God used him to speak to me, I think I’d be in a totally different place today.  A couple weeks ago I posted a prayer request on my blog, but now I want to put the anonymous request together with the real man, and his wife, so you can not only have faces to go with the prayers, but now you can find <a href="http://www.inspiritandtruth.net/">regular updates</a> to keep your prayers current.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <blockquote>5. <i>Occasional victories over sin are not mortification.</i>  There are two occasions or seasons in which a man who is fighting with a particular sin may seem to have mortified it, but has not in reality.  (i) When that sin breaks out sadly and seriously in a way that greatly disturbs his peace, terrifies his conscience, brings the dread of scandal, and clearly provokes the Lord to judgment.  This may awaken and stir up all that is in that man, filling him with the abhorrence of sin, and sending him to God to cry out for life and help to set himself against the sin.  The whole man, both spiritual and natural, is aroused.  Sin shrinks.  The sin in question appears to lie dead before him.  It is like a soldier who draws near the enemy lines and kills an important person.  The guards then awake and make strict inquiry after the enemy.  The enemy, meanwhile, has hidden himself like one that is dead until the noise and tumult is over.  Though for the time being he is quiet, there is in his mind the firm resolution to do more mischief at the first opportunity.  (John Owen, <i>The Mortification of Sin</i>, abr. R. Rushing, Banner of Truth, pp. 29-30)</blockquote>

      <h2><a href="/2005/03/01/god-centered-worship/">God-Centered Worship</a></h2>
      <blockquote>In considering the rationale for God-centered worship, we must begin with the realization that worship is the number one priority of the Church.  Jesus' famous statement in John 4:23 that the Father <i>seeks</i> worshipers is unparalleled, for nowhere in the entire corpus of Holy Scripture do we read of God's seeking anything else from a child of God.  <i>God desires worship above all else.</i><br /><br />Thus, every man who calls himself a Christian must understand that worship is the ultimate priority of his life.  Worship is what God wants from you and from me.  Jesus hallowed and substantiated this in His chiding of busy, frenetic Martha, who was so critical of her sister's sitting at Jesus' feet: "Martha, Martha . . . you are worried and upset about many things, but only one thing is needed.  Mary has chosen what is better, and it will not be taken away from her" (Luke 10:41, 42). (R. Kent Hughes, <i>Disciplines of a Godly Man</i>, 111)</blockquote>
<blockquote>Nowhere in all the Scriptures do we read of God's seeking anything else from the child of God.  One often hears that Christians are "saved to serve," and there is a limited sense in which this is true, for throughout eternity as well as during our earthly life it will be our joy and privilege to serve the Lord God.  But this heavenly service will itself be primarily worship (see Heb. 9:14; 12:28; Rev. 22:3).  Nowhere in the Bible are we told that the Lord seeks our service.  It is not servants He seeks, but true worshipers. (Robert G. Rayburn, <i>O Come, Let Us Worship</i>, 15)</blockquote>

      <p>Oswald Chambers wrote:<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;There are times when it seems as if God watches to see if we will give Him even small gifts of surrender, just to show how genuine our love is for Him. To be surrendered to God is of more value than our personal holiness. Concern over our personal holiness causes us to focus our eyes on ourselves, and we become overly concerned about the way we walk and talk and look, out of fear of offending God. “. . . but perfect love casts out fear . . .” once we are surrendered to God ( 1 John 4:18 ). We should quit asking ourselves, “Am I of any use?” and accept the truth that we really are not of much use to Him. The issue is never of being of use, but of being of value to God Himself. Once we are totally surrendered to God, He will work through us all the time.

It’s by Mark Salomon, the lead singer of the classic and influential Christian punk band The Crucified, who set the stage for other bands like The Blamed and Officer Negative, and 90 Pound Wuss.  In the mid 90s, he started the Christian rock band Stavesacre, which was originally signed to Tooth and Nail, but now they’re on Nitro records (as in The Offspring).<br /><br />This is a guy I admire.  He shaves his head, and he has a tattoo in Hebrew on his bicep.  The first time I ever saw him–it must have been in 1995–Stavesacre was playing a show in Orange County, and they started out with a beautiful, feedback-driven song called “Minus”, which is called that because only three members of the band participate (it is an instrumental and Mark is just a singer).  Normally, you’d think the guy would either be waiting backstage, or dancing around like a drunken lunatic, but Mark was standing there in the middle of the stage, with his back to the audience, his arms raised in worship, and his eyes on the cross on the front wall of the church fellowship hall.  The sight definitely made a lasting impression on me.<br /><br />The other day, Relevant Magazine e-mailed me a chapter from the book, and I think it ties in directly with what Chambers was saying about the difference between visible holiness (to be seen by men) and extravagant devotion.  Here’s a teaser:<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;Be it for the praise of other Christians, or just to get them off your back, the desire to have people praise your progress in the faith can be just as vain as the need to be seen as a success by your peers, or society, or any of those other forms of “acceptable” ego-stroking. Since the very essence of God’s grace is that He has given us unmerited mercy in return for our wickedness, ego should have nothing to do with our growth as Christians. I believe that taking pride in driving a better car or having a nicer house than your neighbor is no less a matter of pride as the desire to hear other Christians praise your so-called godliness. While it’s good to encourage others by maturing in your faith, just as the spiritual maturity of those around us is encouraging, it’s also easy to get off track. I’m talking about that need for a spiritual “Atta-boy!” or a better seat in church on Sunday, or the always dangerous acceptance into that inner circle of “church staff.” (No, I don’t think that the position of a church staff member is evil. I just know that if Christianity is treated like a social club, it often has the same entanglements as one. From someone who spent half of his life growing up in churches, I can say it happens, and more often than you might think.) &lt;/blockquote&gt;<br /><br /><br />    <img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/s/noscript?tag=lbmusic" alt="" /><br />&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;<img width="1" height="1" src="" alt="" />&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <p>I know I quote Oswald Chambers a lot, but there’s something about his daily devotional that makes it continually relevant.  However, sometimes I end up skipping a day.  The Feb. 18 entry is one particular one that ministered to me.  I’m wondering whether I skipped it last year, because I know that hearing it would have done me some good.<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;The sense of having done something irreversible tends to make us despair. We say, “Well, it’s all over and ruined now; what’s the point in trying anymore.” If we think this kind of despair is an exception, we are mistaken. It is a very ordinary human experience. Whenever we realize we have not taken advantage of a magnificent opportunity, we are apt to sink into despair. But Jesus comes and lovingly says to us, in essence, “Sleep on now. That opportunity is lost forever and you can’t change that. But get up, and let’s go on to the next thing.” In other words, let the past sleep, but let it sleep in the sweet embrace of Christ, and let us go on into the invincible future with Him…  Never let the sense of past failure defeat your next step.

      <h2><a href="/2005/02/12/the-blessedness-of-possessing-nothing/">&quot;The Blessedness of Possessing Nothing&quot;</a></h2>
      <p>“Share in suffering as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.  No soldier gets entangled in civilian pursuits, since his aim is to please the one who enlisted him.” 2 Tim. 2:3-4 (ESV)<br /><br />“Then Jesus told his disciples, ‘If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.’”  Matt. 16:24-25 (ESV)<br /><br />This week I went to a worship conference with Sam and Kevin.  One recurring theme at the conference was the need for worship leaders to recognize that we don’t bring anything to the table, that God does not need us, and that when God calls us, we need to leave all of our past accomplishments as well as future ambitions behind.<br /><br />On Thursday night, before I went to sleep, I read chapter 2 in <i>The Pursuit of God</i>, “The Blessedness of Possessing Nothing.”  At first glance, the chapter appears to be about materialism, but when you go deeper, you find it is more about the sin of putting anything other than God on the throne of your heart, whether that be material things, people, abilities, ambitions, ideas, desires, dreams, whatever.<br /><br />At first, as I read, I was thinking about a certain materialistic person whom I had known, and how correct I was in my opinion of the wrongness of this materialism, and how right I was in choosing to dissociate myself from this individual.  But when we read, we cannot read for other people.  Even a preacher who is reading in order to prepare a sermon that has to be made relevant to a congregation, has to first read for himself.  “We preach best what we need to learn most.”  So a better application than strengthening my resolve against other people’s materialism is to humbly recognize my own idols.<br /><br />For example, the idea of getting married was an idol for me, for a very long time.  I made compromises in critical areas, the way musical artists might sell out on their convictions and their friends in order to get a recording contract.  This was such a bad issue for me, and even when healing is complete and I’m ready to open up my heart to make it available to somebody else in the future, I doubt that Theoretical Future Girl will be able to believe that I’m really interested in her and not just in the idea of marriage.<br /><br />The core of the chapter uses Abraham’s attempted sacrifice of Isaac as an illustration.  By asking Abraham to kill his only son, God humbled him and took away all of his earthly security, and thus reset his priorities.  In the same way I had to come to a place where I was humiliated, in order to discover in my shame that the whole wanting to get married thing was an idol for me after all.  This is an area God’s been dealing with in my heart for months, but right now what I’m learning is that idolatry has deeper roots than what is visible or obvious, and it has to do fundamentally with our understanding of contentment.<br /><br />This week I came to a realization that the word <i>contentment</i> does not mean what we think it means, and I think that it is possible for us to have idols and not know it, and it is by changing our definition that these very idols will be exposed.<br /><br />I once had a friendship that was so special to me, I said that I could go the rest of my life and be okay, even if I never got married, as long as I still had this friendship with this girl.  And in so thinking, I thought I was being content, and therefore spiritual.  But that’s not contentment at all.  Biblical contentment is not the same thing as being happy with the status quo and not wanting more than we already have.  No, true spiritual contentment is being happy <i>even if everything we have is taken away from us</i>, because our treasure and our hope is internal, and it is eternal.  In this way, expressions of perceived contentment can actually point out idolatry in our lives, when we are expressing satisfaction with things we hope will not be taken away, when we are satisfied with God’s gifts rather than with God.  Even a friendship can be an idol, when you say it’s the one thing that will keep you happy as long as you get to hold onto it forever.<br /><br />Everything was different for Abraham after the trial was over.  As Tozer puts it,<br /><br />&lt;blockquote&gt;The old man of God lifted his head to respond to the Voice, and stood there on the mount strong and pure and grand, a man marked out by the Lord for special treatment, a friend and favorite of the Most High.  Now he was a man wholly surrendered, a man utterly obedient, a man who possessed nothing.  He had concentrated his all in the person of his dear son, and God had taken it from him.  God could have begun out on the margin of Abraham’s life and worked inward to the center.  He chose rather to cut quickly to the heart and have it over in one sharp act of separation…&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I have said that Abraham possessed nothing.  Yet was not this poor man rich?  Everything he had owned before was his still to enjoy: sheep, camels, herds, and goods of every sort.  He had also his wife and his friends, and best of all he had his son Isaac safe by his side.  He had everything, <i>but he possessed nothing</i>.  There is the spiritual secret.  There is the sweet theology of the heart which can be learned only in the school of renunciation. (p. 27)&lt;/blockquote&gt;What God did to Abraham produced a profound change of character that affected how he looked at everything else in his life.  In the same way, in terms of applying this in our own lives, we need to look to make sure that we get the full affect of what God has done to us when we go through experiences like this; that we don’t just see the one particular issue he addresses as being re-ordered in our lives, but that the root of idolatry is completely eradicated!<br /><br />The next morning, we led worship for the whole group gathered there and Sam spoke on Genesis 22.  Lord, are you trying to tell me something?&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;<img width="1" height="1" src="" alt="" />&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <p><span style="font-style:italic;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">DISCLAIMER:</span> A.W. Tozer was an Arminian.  If he doesn’t have a Biblical understanding of the Gospel of Grace, it’s difficult to see how his teaching could be beneficial to the soul.<br /><br />Original post:<br /></span><br />This is the first installment in a planned chapter-by-chapter look at A.W. Tozer’s book, <i>The Pursuit of God</i>.  Granted, there are many who have discovered the book long before I did, who will also be much better equipped for a task such as this.  But hey, this is a blog, so I’m just going to write what I think.<br /><br />I think first heard about A.W. Tozer’s book, <i>The Pursuit of God</i>, ten years ago, mentioned in a sermon from Pastor Dave Owen at the Malibu Vineyard.  Each time Dave would quote Tozer, I’d write it down in my notebook and make a note that I needed to get a copy of that book!  Well, I still don’t have a copy, but I found one of Pastor Sam’s copies sitting in a box in the upstairs hallway near my work area, so I opened it up, and it blew me away immediately.<br /><br />What I wrote in my last entry–“Can you really go up on the mountain, enter the Lord’s presence, and not have thoughts of any other people enter your mind as soon as you close your eyes to pray or to worship?”–is something I struggle with periodically.  It doesn’t just have to do with people with whom you have issues, but it has to do with your mind racing while you’re trying to concentrate on the Lord, and I remember it being an issue even 10 years ago at Group at the Ferguson’s house in Malibu.  The introduction to Tozer’s book calls this “turbulence of soul”, and says that the quietness cannot be found in “cloistered retreats”.  Monasticism and asceticism are not going to get you there.  It’s an internal thing with has to do with your direct connection to God and whether you’re keeping that line open, no matter how noisy your surroundings.  As the writer of the introduction says, “He came upon this closer walk with God in the bustle and noise of the city of Chicago.  Tozer never enjoyed the luxury of a cloistered life” (<i>The Pursuit of God</i>, p. 5).<br /><br />Another thing that stuck out with me in the introduction is the way Tozer brought God into every aspect of his life.<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;[He] educated himself by years of diligent study and a constant prayerful seeking of the mind of God.  With Tozer, seeking truth and seeking God were one and the same thing.  For example, when he felt he needed an understanding of the great English works of Shakespeare, he read them through on his knees, asking God to help him understand their meaning. (p. 6)&lt;/blockquote&gt;That’s cool!<br /><br />If Tozer were alive today, I think he’d be a blogger.  He has that kind of attitude in his writing that I see a lot in the blogs of those with new reformation views, those who see problems with the way we Americans practice Christianity today, and seek to change it.  In his own preface, he writes about the difference between a right opinion of God and true spiritual worship.  He says worship has been replaced with programs, and although strong Bible teaching is a <i>must</i>, it is not enough.  “For it is not mere words that nourish the soul, but God Himself, and unless and until the hearers find God in personal experience they are not the better for having heard the truth” (p.10).<br /><br />Now to make it personal.  This is the reason I wanted to write this installment today: the theme of the first chapter in the book, the one that explains why we should pursue God in the first place, is the same theme of U2 had in their song, “I Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For”.  Many Christians felt like U2 had abandoned their faith with that song and looked at it as the proof that they had turned away from following God completely.  After all, if someone has truly found Jesus, what could he possibly still be looking for?  I have heard this opinion expressed by individuals with my own ears, as well as read articles that confirm that this is a very widespread view among many Christians, and it’s very sad.<br /><br />Tozer’s point in Chapter 1 is that finding Jesus is not the end, but only the beginning, and reading this chapter has caused me to seriously suspect that Bono read Tozer before he wrote the song.<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;<i>I believe in the kingdom come<br />Then all the colors will bleed into one<br />Bleed into one<br />Well yes I’m still running<br /><br />You broke the bonds and you<br />Loosed the chains<br />Carried the cross<br />Of my shame<br />Of my shame<br />You know I believe it<br /><br />But I still haven’t found what I’m looking for</i>&lt;/blockquote&gt;Tozer’s view is that the belief is the first step into a much larger world.  There is belief, and then there is knowledge.  “The doctrine of justification by faith–a biblical truth, and blessed relief from sterile legalism and unavailing self-effort–has in our time fallen into evil company and been interpreted by many in such a manner as actually to bar men from the knowledge of God.”<br /><br />A mark of spiritual maturity is the realization that the journey will never end, that our <i>relationship</i> with the Lord is something that we have to cultivate and continue to do so until our final breath.<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;We have almost forgotten that God is a person and, as such, can be cultivated as any person can.  It is inherent in personality to be able to know other personalities, but full knowledge of one personality by another cannot be achieved in one encounter.  It is only after long and loving mental intercourse that the full possibilities of both can be explored. (p. 13)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;<i>You know I believe it<br />But I still haven’t found…</i>&lt;/blockquote&gt;Tozer writes, “To have found God and still to pursue Him is the soul’s paradox of love, scorned indeed by the too-easily-satisfied religionist, but justified in happy experience by the children of the burning heart” (p. 15).  Are you willing to embark on that quest?  It’s a journey of individual discovery to know God for yourself, but you’ll find there are others who have gone before, whose writings and reflections are like signposts to us, and there are also others today who are on the same road themselves.<br /><br />“And this is eternal life, that they know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent” (John 17:3, ESV).<br /><br />Find Him!  Seek Him with all your heart!&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <p>Life is a journey.<br /><br />The English words <i>journal</i> and <i>journal</i> are borrowed from Middle French, and share the same root, <i>jour</i>, meaning day.  Life is a journey, and journals, whether they be travel journals or journals written at home, convey that attitude.  A.W. Tozer in <i>The Pursuit of God</i> does a good job of illustrating the spiritual walk as a lifelong journey, growth in personal intimacy with God, a trip of the kind where you never reach the end, because there is always further to go.<br /><br />So that’s why I’ve converted the blog from the “i once had dreads…” theme (about the past) to the road theme, which is about a continued journey into the future.  The poem is from Tolkien.  The original banner picture was taken at Deer Creek Falls on Hwy. 32, but I plan to change it up every once in a while with new pictures of new roads.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;<img width="1" height="1" src="" alt="" />&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <h2><a href="/2005/02/06/grace-restoration-and-blank-slates/">Grace, Restoration, and Blank Slates</a></h2>
      <p>There’s a passage I wish I would have read earlier this morning.  According to my reading calendar I should have read it last night; but if I had, it’s questionable whether my heart would have been in a place to receive such a pertinent application.<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;The LORD said to Moses, “Cut for yourself two tablets of stone like the first, and I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke.  Be ready by the morning, and come up in the morning to Mount Sinai, and present yourself there to me on the top of the mountain.  No one shall come up with you, and let no one be seen throughout all the mountain.  Let no flocks or herds graze opposite that mountain.”  Exodus 34:1-3 (ESV)&lt;/blockquote&gt;It’s been a pretty <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emo</a> weekend for me.  So much so that a good buddy called me a girl.  A few months ago, Pastor Sam taught out of Philippians 3, and he spoke on not letting the past hinder you.  I’ve been having a hard time making that a reality in my life.  But I think Exodus 34 paints a picture of moving on that we can apply to ourselves spiritually.  It’s been a whole two chapters since the Golden Calf incident in chapter 32, and the Lord had already given the order to move on in Exodus 33:1.<br /><br />We start chapter 34 with a blank slate.  Two fresh tablets; and God, in his everlasting, ever patient grace, is going to write his law all over again (on our hearts–<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=jeremiah%2031:33&amp;version=47" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jer 31:33</a>).  Even though we broke it, he’s going to make it right for us.  Often in our lives we experience the ungrace of “you broke it; you fix it,” but when it comes to issues of the soul, only God can fix what we break.<br /><br />The second point I got was the timliness and immediacy of it.  Once God decides it’s time for restoration, our response is to be immediate.  “Be ready by the morning.”  The time for restoration has come.  The Father knows there’s some stuff we have to take care of (packing our bags, as it were), but we only have a few hours.  In the morning it will be time to get a move on!<br /><br />“Present yourself…  No one shall come up with you.”  It’s between you and God.  When God calls me to move on, I can’t sit there and say, “But so-and-so did this, and so-and-so did that.”  This one-on-one approach to the Lord means I have to let go of the bitterness towards those who hurt me, as well as my guilt and shame in hurting other people.  And it also means I have to grasp the fact my relationship with God is really my own, and I cannot have a vicarious spirituality through other people.<br /><br />“Let no one be seen.”  The Lord’s will is that we be cleansed of our soul ties.  Can you really go up on the mountain, enter the Lord’s presence, and not have thoughts of any other people enter your mind as soon as you close your eyes to pray or to worship?  This is a command of the Lord, something he tells <i>US</i> to take care of when we climb.  It’s our responsibility to remove all other persons from view.<br /><br />Finally, God requires us to be rid of our personal entourage.  “Let no flocks or herds…”  When it comes to our relationship with God, we have to “undress ourselves” (<a href="http://www.gospelcom.net/rbc/utmost/08/18/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as Chambers says</a>) of all that we have.  Whether it be academic or occupational or musical or social skills or anything else that we see ourselves as bringing to the table.  In the economy of grace, there is nothing, absolutely nothing, that we bring to the table.  Our own righteousness is as filthy rags!<br /><br />Before Israel left Egypt, Moses had suggested that Pharaoh let them make a short spiritual pilgrimage to offer sacrifices in the desert.  Pharaoh wanted them to leave their flocks and herds behind, but they needed to bring them in order to sacrifice.  But at this point in Exodus 34, they had already left Egypt.  Egypt is a type of the world.  Once you leave, there is no going back.  God has removed us from the world and our sins have been atoned for, and we have consecrated ourselves and made a commitment.  We’ve already stumbled and experienced the consequences, so we’re aware that we can’t do it on our own.  But Jesus’ shed blood on the cross is a once-for-all atonement, covering all our failures, past present, and future.  When God offers us a clean slate and calls us to restoration, there are no more flocks or herds…  There are no more sacrifices to be made.  It’s just me and Him, one on one, and I know that it’s all Him.  He’s the one upholding the covenant for the both of us.<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;Behold, I am making a covenant.  Before all your people I will do marvels, such as have not been created in all the earth or in any nation.  And all the people among whom you are shall see the work of the LORD, for it is an awesome thing that I will do with you.”  Exodus 34:10 (ESV)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;<img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2602771351651662379-2272729667941821263?l=mustfollow.blogspot.com" alt="" />&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <h2><a href="/2005/02/03/the-community-and-the-call/">The Community and the Call</a></h2>
      <p>When consoling me about a church split before I moved to Chico, my mom said, “Church would be wonderful if it weren’t for the people…”  She was pointing out through irony the fact that the body of our perfect savior Jesus Christ is in fact made up of imperfect human beings, yet at the same time, <b>you cannot have a church without people</b>, because church is a community (Greek <i>ekklesia</i>).<br /><br />When you serve in any area of ministry, whether the place is a big ol’ megachurch or a teeny home fellowship, you’re bound to come across people who just get on your nerves.  Sometimes it’s people who are bogged down in their mediocrity and have no desire to learn or grow.  Sometimes it’s people who are bogged down in their carnality and have no desire to kick the habit and walk in freedom.  Sometimes it’s people like me who come across as too busy to care so they just rush by you in the hallway on their way to fix some technical difficulty in the sanctuary, missing the tree for the forest, as if living by the Vulcan mantra, “The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few…”  (And if I’ve ever come across that way to any of you, I sincerely apologize!)<br /><br />And sometimes it’s people who are so prideful and sure of their own rightness, who go around trying to conform everyone else to unanimity.  Chuck Swindoll calls them “grace killers”, who are operating in their own strength rather than living by the Spirit.  “Pride, which is at the heart of legalism, works in sync with other motivating factors.  Like guilt.  And fear.  And shame.  It leads to an emphasis on what should <i>not</i> be, and what one should <i>not</i> do.  It flourishes in a drab context of negativism.”  (Swindoll, <i>The Grace Awakening</i>, p. 84).  So now we have both ends of the spectrum: slackers and legalists.  Pastor Will said to me recently, “God uses all those types of people to refine us, to shape us, to teach us patience and to mature us.”<br /><br />The statement, “If it weren’t for the people…”, redirects your focus and puts it on who is the Head of the church.  It helps you to remember that it’s not about us, it’s about Him, and His wonderful gift of Grace!  And therefore we can relax, because, as the Head, He is the only One who has the power to make all the parts line up.<br /><br />When I read yesterday’s entry in Oswald Chambers’ <i>My Utmost for His Highest</i>, I saw that he points out the difference between people who are saved and people who are disciples.  It can be really frustrating when people just won’t change their lifestyle and actually behave like Christians ought to.  But perhaps they’re not called to discipleship?  And if so, it’s okay!  The only requirement for us when it comes to Salvation is to “Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be saved” (see Acts 16:31, NKJV).  Sure, it makes my service easier if they have the same vision for ministry, the same calling to purity, etc., but if they don’t, I need to just love them, and not take it so personally.  The Call is between the Lord and His servant.  There are no third parties involved.<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;Woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!” (1 Cor. 9:16) … Beware of stopping your ears to the call of God.  Everyone who is saved is called to testify to the fact; but that is not the call to preach, it is merely an illustration in preaching.  Paul is referring to the pangs produced in him by the constraint to preach the Gospel.  Never apply what Paul says in this connection to souls coming in contact with God for salvation.  There is nothing easier than getting saved because it is God’s sovereign work–Come unto Me and I will save you.  Our Lord never lays down the conditions of discipleship as the conditions of salvation.  We are condemned to salvation through the Cross of Jesus Christ.  [That is, figuratively speaking, the Father <i>dooms</i> us to salvation when He <i>judges</i> us as holy through the lens of the Cross of Christ.]  Discipleship has an option with it–“If any man…“<br /><br />Paul’s words have to do with being made a servant of Jesus Christ, and our permission is never asked as to what we will do or where we will go.  God makes us broken bread and poured-out wine to please Himself.  To be “separated unto the gospel” means to hear the call of God; and when a man begins to overhear that call, then begins agony that is worthy of the name.  Every ambition is nipped in the bud, every desire of life quenched, every outlook completely extinguished and blotted out, saving one thing only–“<i>separated unto the gospel</i>.”  Woe be to the soul who tries to put his foot in any other direction when once that call has come to him. (Chambers, <i>My Utmost for His Highest</i>, p. 33)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;<img width="1" height="1" src="" alt="" />&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <p>So, I’m sorry I haven’t blogged in a while.  I read something in Oswald Chambers over Christmas vacation about how God uses silent seasons in our lives to speak to us, or to draw us into waiting dependence.  Sorry, that doesn’t necessarily mean new blogs are going to be terribly profound…<br /><br />Last night Flogging Molly played a show at the Senator, but I couldn’t go because it was sold out.  I saw a friend at Worship Generation tonight and she told me she had a ticket but didn’t go, so I totally could’ve gone!  Dangit!<br /><br />This morning I played fiddle and mandolin for worship with Sam and Kevin.  It was the first time I’ve played with them since I stepped down last summer.  It’s so good to be back!!!  I got new D’Addario Helicore violin strings yesterday for the occasion.  I know, I’ve been using Dominants for almost 20 years, but they didn’t have any full size Dominants in stock, and these were 10 to 15 bucks cheaper (still $40).  They have a stranded steel core instead of synthetic gut like Dominant, but they sound really good.  Apparently these are the strings bluegrass players use, and they’re suitable for electric violins as well.  I think they produced a more even tone plugged in this morning than Dominants do.  Good stuff!<br /><br />Lifehouse recently released their new single.  It’s an old song of Jason’s from the FKA days when Jon and I used to play with him, so I got a little bit emo about it.  But God used the situation to deal with me.  I read Chapter 9 in Chuck Swindoll’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0849918057/lbmusic"><i>The Grace Awakening</i></a> last week, and it appropriately dealt with the kind of stuff I’m dealing with, with old church split issues, old broken relationships in Scotland, old broken band dreams, etc.  It’s called “Graciously Disagreeing and Pressing On”.  Chuck has some really good “Insight” (get it?) on Paul and Barnabas’s split, and how it’s sometimes God’s will for such things to happen–that it’s sometimes God’s way of moving his people “on to another dimension of ministry” (p. 195).<br /><br />I highly recommend this chapter, especially the section on Paul and Barnabas, but if you can, read the whole thing.<br /><br />He draws the illustration of Paul and Barnabas into the points he made in an earlier chapter about the fact that an argument usually consists of an objective truth, and then two subjective viewpoints, and it’s important for a person in an argument to make a differentiation between what the objective truth is and what the personal viewpoints are.  Chuck says Paul and Barnabas both had equally valid viewpoints when it came to the issue of John Mark’s dissertion.  Both of them were in the right when they chose the path they chose, but it was a very bitter split because they couldn’t compromise at the time.  However, later in life, Paul still spoke affectionately of both Barnabas and John Mark in his letters.<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;Many people today emotionally are sitting in dark rooms, eaten up with bitterness because of an argument that they had with someone a long time ago.  They feel they were humiliated or they feel they weren’t listened to.  How many are living out their lives with their spiritual shades drawn, thinking to themselves, <i>I’ll have nothing more to do with the church</i> because of an argument they witnessed or maybe participated in?  We need to be people who can disagree in grace and then press on, even if the disagreement leads to a separation. (191-2)&lt;/blockquote&gt;Here’s an important point Chuck makes a couple pages later, and it really resonated with me:<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;There was a time in my life when I had answers to questions no one was asking.  I had a position that was so rigid I would fight for every jot and tittle.  I mean, I couldn’t list enough things that I’d die for.  The older I get, the shorter that list get’s, frankly. (194)&lt;/blockquote&gt;That’s an important breakthrough for young Christians who enjoy their theological arguments.  Chuck also talks about how Christ’s body is One, though there are many parts, and, Calvinists, covenant theologians, charismatics, pre- or post-millennial, pre- or post-trib– “We disagree on certain points of doctrine, but we’re on the same team.  We’re going to spend eternity together.  We’re going to meet the Lord in the air (whether they believe it or not!).  So we might as well enjoy each other’s company on earth” (p. 193).<br /><br />Good stuff.<br /><br />While I have your attention, I want to point out what Oswald Chambers had to say today.  Here’s an excerpt: “Without the sovereign hand of God Himself, nothing touches our lives. Do we discern His hand at work, or do we see things as mere occurrences?”  If you don’t have a copy, you can read the full entry <a href="http://www.gospelcom.net/rbc/utmost/01/30/">online</a>.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <h2><a href="/2005/01/11/the-trouble-with-scottish-presbyterians/">The trouble with Scottish Presbyterians</a></h2>
      <p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/cosic-logo.jpg" style="clear:right;float:right;margin-bottom:1em;margin-left:1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/cosic-logo.jpg?w=201" width="134" /></a><br />Western Europe is the new missionfield.  According to the <a href="http://www.scottishchristian.com/features/0305census01.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scottish Church Census</a>, only 11.2% of Scots attended church on an average Sunday in 2002.  And those who do are mostly old people.  This is higher than England (7.5%), but compare this with the U.S. at 40% (<a href="http://www.barna.org/FlexPage.aspx?Page=BarnaUpdate&amp;BarnaUpdateID=120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Barna</a>), and a 1997 report by the <a href="http://www.adherents.com/Na/Na_44.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Michigan</a> that puts South Africa at 56%, the Philippines at 68%, and Nigeria at a whopping 89%!<br /><br />One <a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2843/is_2_28/ai_114090210" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> by Phil Zuckerman points out how drastically this change came about in only a couple generations: “In Aberdeen, Scotland, in 1851, 60 percent of the adult population attended church; in 1995 that was down to 11 percent.”<br /><br />The journalist also throws in some anecdotes from personal experience:<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;The last time I was in Europe, I was told by two different sets of friends that we would be “going out to the church” for the evening. In both cases (one in Oban, Scotland, and the other in Cologne, Germany) the churches turned out to be religious institutions in facade only; both were former churches that had been gutted and turned into popular pubs and night clubs. Indeed, throughout much of Western Europe–with the unique exception of Ireland–churches are being turned into bars, discos, warehouses, and laundromats. Not only is church attendance way down, but so is religious belief.&lt;/blockquote&gt;The culture has changed so much that people actually have to second-guess what you mean when you say you’re “going to church!”<br /><br />Many Scots are wasting their lives away in bondage to drugs and alcohol.  In almost every city you go to, whether it’s Aberdeen, Glasgow, or Inverclyde, the locals will tell you it’s the heroin capital of Europe.  They are not living the lives of freedom that their ancestors fought and died for!<br /><br />So we’ve established that only a ridiculously small percentage of people go to church in Scotland.  So how can Presbyterianism be the right way?  I would say that the mysteries, complexities, and paradoxes of the balance and partnership (<a href="https://www.devlord.io/blog/2005/01/10/killing-our-idolatrous-desires/">MARRIAGE!</a>) between God’s sovereign will and man’s responsibility are so vast that you either have to leave it alone completely and walk by faith, or you need to keep wrestling with it until God brings you to a point where, though it might not make perfect sense, you finally reach the conclusion that there has to be a balance of the two.<br /><br />Delving just a little into Calvinism is dangerous.  You may get to the place where you say, like many Scottish Presbyterians do, that God is sovereign, so it doesn’t matter what I do.  I’ll just go to church on Sunday (or not) and leave everyone else alone, because if they were elect of God, then he would cause them to come to faith with no help of my own.<br /><br />The problems are (1) that’s not what Calvin taught, and (2) election does not negate preaching (there is a ton of material by John Piper, Charles Spurgeon, and others on this very subject).<br /><br />Bruce Shelley said if Luther’s key verse was “the just shall live by faith,” then Calvin’s was, “Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.”  The emphasis here is not that God’s will is going to be done no matter what I do (it will, but if you don’t cooperate then he’s going to find someone else to work through), but the emphasis is on how our desire for His will to be done should affect our prayer life, our daily actions and lifestyle, and our preaching!<br /><br />Shelley writes, “The consequence of faith to Calvin–far more than to Luther–is strenuous effort to introduce the kingdom of God on earth….God calls the elect for his purpose!” (Church History in Plain Language, 261).<br />As a kingdom of priests, we all have direct access to the throne room of God, and we all are supposed to represent His interests on the earth.  His will is done through us, which is why we need to cooperate with Him.  We have to choose God’s will.  We are called for His purpose.  And his will is that all might be saved.  “Even so it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish” (Mt 18:14, NKJV).  We were all little kids once.   And 1 Tim. 2:4 says that God “<i>desires</i> all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth” (ESV).<br /><br />Instead of arguing and debating about the supposed unreality of everyone getting saved, we have to realize (1) God’s reality is higher and more real than the realm we see with our eyes, and (2) we have to be saturated by God’s desires and look on others with his heart towards them.  If God looks at people and <i>desires</i> their salvation, then his elect needs to look on people and <i>desire</i> their salvation.<br /><br />The point of Calvin’s teachings which is missed by some of the fatalistic, pseudo-Hindi, psuedo-Muslim neo-hyper-Calvinists, is to see God’s kingdom come here on earth.  We are called according to his purpose.  Like Sarmatian knights, we have been given our orders, revealed in Scripture, and it’s up to us to choose whether we will fulfill them.<br /><br />“I now know that all the blood I have shed, all the lives I have taken, have led me to this moment.”  <i>King Arthur</i> (2004 film)&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <blockquote>Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more. And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, "Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God. He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning nor crying nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away." (Revelation 21:1-4, ESV)</blockquote>
<p>There’s something wrong with our planet.  Seriously wrong.  Devastatingly wrong.  Hurricanes, volcanoes, tornadoes, earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, even ice ages.  These are imperfections that resulted from the curse, when the Lord removed Adam and Eve from the garden in Genesis 3.  But why did God do this?  Why did he make the Earth a more dangerous place?  Was it just to make us feel guilty about Original Sin?  No!  He did it to increase our desire for restoration with Him, and to increase our Hope for heaven!<br /><br />Romans 8:22-23 (NKJV) says,<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;For we know that the whole creation groans and labors with birth pangs together until now. Not only that, but we also who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, eagerly waiting for the adoption, the redemption of our body.&lt;/blockquote&gt;The despair that we have with our current planet <i>increases</i> our hope for the New Heaven and the New Earth!  The terrible imperfection now points to the great future perfection we long for!  Creation, as well as our own bodily pains and weaknesses that we experience, cause our great longing for our future hope to grow more and more!<br /><br />How does a Christian cope with such devastating loss? Through the hope he has that one day it won’t be like this anymore. In verses 24-25, Paul points to this hope, this collective desire for something more, something better, something safe, as our reason for perseverance: “For we were saved in this hope, but hope that is seen is not hope; for why does one still hope for what he sees? But if we hope for what we do not see, we eagerly wait for it with perseverance.”<br /><br />To all those who have lost loved ones on the sea over the centuries, or those who lost everything in the tsunamis, our Lord has great news: “The sea was no more.” (Rev. 21:1)  There will be no more destructive waves, no more sharks, no more drowning, no more death by hypothermia.  But it’s not just the threat of a watery death that will be removed.  The Lord is going to take away all of our pain, all of our sorrow.  “He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning nor crying nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.” (Rev. 21:4)<br />&lt;h2&gt;Southeast Asia Tsunami Disaster Relief&lt;/h2&gt;I’m not even going to give you a number right now.  If I did, it would be outdated by the time you read this, because the death toll is rising so quickly.

      <h2><a href="/2004/12/24/wrestling-with-god/">Wrestling with God</a></h2>
      <p>I’m studying a lot about the biblical Jacob and the practice of wrestling with God.  But lately there’s a big question I’m struggling with, and that is knowing when to go with the flow and trust that God in charge, and when to intervene because it depends on you.<br /><br />Steve Stockman, in his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/088419793X/lbmusic"><i>Walk On: The Spiritual Journey of U2</i></a>, relates Jacob’s story to Bono’s.  When I read over the passage a second time, I noticed another dimension to the story I had never grasped before.  When Jacob was wrestling with God, he didn’t know who he was at first.  Just some guy who comes up and starts wrestling with him.  “The mysterious agressor eventually was understood to be God, and Jacob got a new name…” (p. 153-4).  This is what I saw: here Jacob is, wrestling with him all night.  By dawn he realizes the physical circumstance has spiritual significance and says, “I will not let you go until you bless me.”  He’s seeking to find the spiritual answer to what’s going on in the natural.  And it’s as if God’s saying, “Do you not recognize me?  Do you not see my hand at work in your life?”  And this is the key: “Do you not see that when you’re wrestling with your father, your brother, your father-in-law, you’re wrestling against ME?”<br /><br />God is all-powerful and sovereign, and while this doesn’t mean that we just sit back and watch the world go by, it does mean that we need to look for His hand in situations and see what he might be doing or trying to teach us, rather than being like Jacob and manipulating everything around us to conform to our own selfish desires.  It was God who was wrestling with Jacob his whole life, but from birth, Jacob was struggling to get his own way.  We need to see God’s hand in our circumstances.  We need to hold on for his blessing in <i>every</i> circumstance.  We need to hold on until he tells us, “This is who you are and this is what I made you for,” rather than building our own castles (made of sand) and looking out for our own interests in every situation.<br />I think that life is like a huge choose-your-own-adventure book: “If you want to go through the door, turn to page 67.  If you want to turn around and go back the way you came, go to page 36.”  God is still the author, but it’s up to us to walk through the doors.  It may take any number of doors, but he’s going to keep putting doors in front of us until we learn, perhaps through painful experiences, how to pick His door.  He will eventually get us where He wants us, and the ending will be what He intended all along.<br /><br />I think there is another layer to this choose-your-own adventure thing, and that’s realizing the difference between regret over the past and whining about things you can’t change, versus standing up to change the things that you can.  The same year I got dropped from the lineup of Lifehouse, we were getting ready for a trip to Scotland, and we were going to be hanging out in St. Andrews in the Kingdom of Fife, which was the same place where Tiger Woods was experiencing a rather hard time in his golf game that same year.  My old pastor in Malibu compared me to him, swinging away over and over with the club, but getting nowhere because I’m stuck in the long grass by the beach.  (Trying the same thing over again expecting a different result, isn’t that the definition of insanity?)  Brad’s prayer in this situation was that I was actually going to find my place, and, like Eric Liddell on that same beach, experience God’s pleasure.<br /><br />It’s taken me a long time to heal from bitterness over past things that were supposed to happen but didn’t because the band was not in control, but the label and the producer were.  I stumbled across the blog of a Christian drummer in a well-known secular band that’s actually on the same label my former band was on.  I dropped him an e-mail, and he wrote me back (blogging is so cool).  He confirmed stuff I had learned about how band loyalty should be more important than label/producer/manager control, and helped solidify my position that sucky things happened to me that aren’t cool at all.<br /><br />But, getting back to choose-your-own-adventure and the God-wrestle, even though God engineers our circumstances, it’s still up to us to choose what we’re going to do in the circumstance and what kind of attitude we’re going to have about the aftermath of our choice (or the thing that happens to us if it’s out of our control).  Chuck Swindoll puts it this way:<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;Life is like a menu in the Grace Restarurant.  In this new establishment you are free to choose whatever you want.  But whatever you choose will be served to you and you must eat it.  If you choose the wrong food and realize later just how badly your body reacted to it, don’t think that grace will protect you from getting sick. (<i>The Grace Awakening</i>, p. 145)&lt;/blockquote&gt;This year I was presented with a circumstance which I believed was engineered by God, and I followed my heart.  But when we are seeking to follow God’s plans for our lives, we need to realize that the right way of walking involves obedience.  In the words of the ancient crusader in <i>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</i>, I “chose poorly”.  The circumstance was engineered by God, but my response was the wrong one.  I think God had equipped me with the discernment and scripture knowledge to know, but I still chose to go through a door that I wasn’t supposed to go through.<br /><br />We have to eat what we ordered and deal with the digestive consequences.  There are times when someone else ordered a bad meal for the whole table, and you just have to have the “horizontal grace” to accept that person’s choice and move on to the next thing God has for you.  And there are times when you chose the wrong plate for your own self (and maybe for someone else as well), and you have to face the consequences.  But the good news is the “vertical grace” that is there for us when we’re ready to get back on track and ask the Head Chef which meal is best for us.<br /><br />Whichever situation we find ourselves in, I’m learning that living with regret and wallowing in guilt will get us nowhere.  As my new cyber-friend pointed out, hopefully we will learn from our mistakes.  But I think we need to look to the future and live in hope of what God’s going to do next rather than suffering from the wounds that He’s already healed.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.leaderu.com/isot/docs/niehbr3.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reinhold Niebuhr</a>, a German-American Confessing Church pastor and professor at Union Theological Seminary, prayed, “God give me the serenity to accept things which cannot be changed; give me the courage to change things which must be changed; and the wisdom to distinguish one from the other.”<br /><br />Thanks: Brad, Pat, Sam, J.B., Zach.<br /><br />Merry Christmas to all!  May you, like Bono, find baby Jesus underneath the trash (wrapping paper).<br /><br /><b>Update: </b>God engineers our circumstances, and we make choices, but he sovereignly knows what we’re going to choose before we choose it. This does not take the responsibility away from us. We are finite, God is infinite. We are fallible, God is perfect and omniscient. But we are still responsible for our sins. His foreknowledge does not let us off the hook. But we can still bring God glory when we fall when we learn from our circumstances and develop a deeper knowledge of our need for his grace.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;<img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2602771351651662379-1468005838588274274?l=mustfollow.blogspot.com" alt="" />&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <p>Okay, so he wasn’t an angel.  And it’s a good thing, too, because this is part of what he wrote: “The life we live is not our own[,] for who’s to say that we’ll live to see tomorrow?”  While it may be theologically correct, there’s something a little foreboding about it when you’re getting on a plane.  Especially when the plane was delayed for two hours due to fog and then another two hours due to a “mechanical” (I know, mechanical is an adjective, and I didn’t supply a noun, but neither did the announcer at the airport when he was telling us that the plane had a mechanical…), and you spent the whole weekend thinking about what Oswald Chambers said about believing that God engineers our circumstances.<br /><br />“But does God cirumcise our engineers?” says my Dad (who’s reading over my shoulder and holding my very cute youngest nephew Joseph).<br /><br />He does engineer our circumstances!  I wore my Delirious? trucker hat on Monday, so two young Christian guys who are going to the Bethel school of ministry in Redding came over and sat by me in the waiting area, and we had some really good talks during the 5 hours that we waited for our flight.  They were a little more charismatic than the people I’ve been fellowshipping with at Calvary, but we shared common ground because of my experience of God’s work in other places.  The conversation centered around the idea that it’s bad to bash your brothers and sisters, and how it’s important to find balance through both having the Holy Spirit and being grounded in God’s Word (one without the other gets you nowhere).  It was a blessing meeting those guys, and I don’t think I’ve ever experienced anything like that while traveling alone.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;<img width="1" height="1" src="" alt="" />&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <p>Someone has suggested that I should expect someone to look through my stuff if I set it down in a bookstore.  I disagree.  If it were for sale, my Bible would be in a little Bible box like all the others.  My notebook wouldn’t be the <i>only</i> notebook in the store, they wouldn’t both have my name on the first page, and they would both have price tags on them.  Furthermore, would you not realize, once you see writing in it, that it’s not a blank journal for sale?  And if you thought it was for sale, why would you start writing in it yourself?  And it’s not that I’m being ungracious.  I’m just taking the opportunity to rant and to vent.  I’m being honest, which is often a rare quality in the church today.  If you know me, you would know that I don’t actually intend harm to these people.<br /><br />If God engineers our circumstances, then we have no right to be frustrated!<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;To be faithful in every circumstance means that we have only one loyalty, and that is to our Lord….If we learn to worship God in the trying circumstances, He will alter them in two seconds when He chooses.  (Oswald Chambers, <i>My Utmost for His Highest</i>, Dec. 18)&lt;/blockquote&gt;There is no such thing as coincidence.  Everything happens for a reason, and I cannot change what happened.  Maybe this guy was an angel and he had a message from the Lord for me.  I don’t know.  But all that I have, all that I am, is the Lord’s.  He can do to me what He wills.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;<img width="1" height="1" src="" alt="" />&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <h2><a href="/2004/12/18/hello-were-you-born-in-a-barn/">HELLO, WERE YOU BORN IN A BARN?!?</a></h2>
      <p>Tonight after the service I went into the church bookstore to look something up.  Pastor Sam was talking about Colossians 1, where Paul says he’s trying to “fill up what is lacking in the afflictions of Christ.”  I remembered from John Piper’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1590521196/lbmusic"><i>Desiring God</i></a> that there’s a parallel verse in Philippians 2:30 where it talks about Epaphroditus “filling up what is lacking” in the Philippians’ service to Paul, and he does that by acting as a messenger.  But, of course, I couldn’t remember where this was, so I had to go in the bookstore to look it up in Zodhiates’ Word Studies.<br /><br />So I sat my Bible and my notebook and my pen on the little table in the bookstore, and while I was looking it up, I turned around and saw a guy thumbing through my precious Moleskine notebook.  I said, “Hello!  That’s personal!” and grabbed it from him.  He said, “Sorry, I didn’t know.  It was just sitting there…”  I suppose he must have thought it was a decoration.  But I opened it up, and some other guy had actually written in it!  Maybe he thought it was a guestbook like my Mom keeps in her guest room for people to leave nice notes in.<br /><br />Who raises their kids like this?!?!  And they were grown-ups, too!  How could they have no concept of ownership?<br /><br />So, since having “In case of loss, please return to:” along with my name and address on the front page apparently isn’t enough to justify my ownership of my own notebook, I’ve had to add the following on the second page:<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;THIS IS NOT YOURS!  PLEASE PUT IT BACK WHERE YOU FOUND IT.  DO NOT READ IT.  IF THE NOTEBOOK APPEARS TO BE LOST, IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT IT BE RETURNED TO ME.  MY NAME AND ADDRESS ARE ON THE FIRST PAGE. <br /><br />&lt;—&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</p>

(In the interest of full disclosure I have to mention that my grandparents go to the Crystal Cathedral, a fact which has embarrassed me for a long time.)  The standoff began less than two hours before the scheduled start of their annual pageant, “The Glory of Christmas.” The conductor, Johnnie Carl, had arranged the music for the show, but it was prerecorded, so it’s not clear whether “the show must go on”…<br /><br />Carl had expressed that not only was his job stressful, but there were also pressures just dealing with people around him.  That’s what happens when your religion is about slick performances rather than gospel authenticity.  Pastor Robert Schuller said, “His music brought joy to the millions of viewers around the world who watch the Crystal Cathedral’s ‘Hour of Power’ television program each week.”  I’d say what he brought wasn’t true joy, but just the appearance of joy.  Too bad he couldn’t plug into the source and receive some of that joy for himself…&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <p><a href="http://www.companysj.com/v162/gandhiashram.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img align="left" alt="© Company Magazine" border="0" height="155" src="http://www.companysj.com/v162/gandhi4.jpg" width="137" /></a> <b>India</b><br /><br />On Tuesday night they had a report on PBS about a Jesuit priest in India who heads up a missionary school where he teaches poor children how to play violin, and he only accepts those in the lowest castes (<a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/entertainment/july-dec04/strings_12-14.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">transcript</a>).<br /><br />It was so awesome!  I want to go and help out in any way I can!  I sent an e-mail to Twin Cities Public Television, who produced the <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/week745/cover.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">original story</a>.  The next morning, they e-mailed me back and said they had forwarded my message to the journalist who did the report, Fred de Sam Lazaro.  Please pray that, if it be God’s will for me to do something in this area, he would enable the necessary connections, and also enable me to be more serious about my violin playing in order to be an effective teacher of large groups of eager students.<br /><br />When I first began ministry in Scotland, I learned new fiddling styles and techniques in order to be more effective there.  The school in India is classically-based and mostly does western music, like Mozart.  But they also have a guy who arranges some traditional Indian tunes for strings.<br />India is still bogged down in karma and caste systems.  As Bono says, grace “travels outside of karma.”  Grace is the opposite, and has a totally different affect on how people are treated socially.  The Indian system has to be changed.  They need Jesus.  If villagers are open to sending their kids to a school run by a Canadian Jesuit to learn how to play western music on the violin, then that is an open door for the gospel!<br /><br /><b>Latin America</b><br />I got a praise report last weekend from Pastor Juan Domingo at Calvary Chapel Ensenada.  It sounds like God’s doing some awesome stuff there.  They’re broadcasting the Bible studies on TV, and it’s become so popular that the TV station is actually paying to place large, full-color ads for the broadcast in the paper.<br />I’ve begun editing Pastor Sam’s studies in the book of John for broadcast on the radio in Belize, and the first broadcast aired on Monday.  Pastor Sam’s idea is that when he returns to do a conference down there, people will know who he is because they will have heard him on the radio.<br />Tonight is the first ever weekly Spanish Bible study at Calvary Chapel Chico.  We’re really excited about it.  I even translated the bulletin announcement into Spanish before I put it online (although Pastor Will had to make some corrections…  I’m not that great at subjunctive tenses).  I got my Biblia Versión Popular out and ready to go!<br /><br /><b>Scotland</b><br />My heart is still in Scotland.  I have enough frequent flyer miles earned for a free flight to London, so theoretically, I could go to the UK any time.  I want to go over during the summer for the CLAN gathering, but I really wanted to go over soon in order to actually spend some quality time with my Scottish friends like the Fyvies and the Espies in their own places of ministry.  Unfortunately, I have been unable to get in touch with anybody over there about organizing such happenings, so I will probably just save my miles for the summer and go over with John Bergin.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <h2><a href="/2004/12/15/winter-intercession/">Winter Intercession</a></h2>
      <p>I’ve been overhearing a lot of Chico State students talking about intercession lately.  Actually, I’m kidding.  They’re really talking about winter inter<i>session</i> (before regular classes resume at the end of January).  But wouldn’t it be cool if it were the other kind of intercession that they were talking about–intercessory <i>prayer</i>?<br /><br />C.S. Lewis said, “Prayer doesn’t change God, it changes me.”  While this is true, it is not just us that prayer changes, but it also has the power to change the world around us.  But if God is in charge, why do we need to pray?<br /><br />We find in Genesis 3 and Psalm 8 expressions of God’s assignment for mankind when he put us here, commonly referred to as the “Dominion Covenant”.  And Psalm 115:16 (NKJV) says,<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;The heaven, even the heavens, are the LORD’s;<br />But the earth He has given to the children of men.<br />&lt;/blockquote&gt;The Hebrew word <i>nathan</i>, here translated “given”, means to “apply, appoint, ascribe, assign,” etc.  Our sovereign, omnipotent God has not abandoned the earth, but he has <i>assigned</i> to us a certain responsibility of governing it.  In <i>The Treasury of David</i>, Charles H. Spurgeon says of this verse,<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;He hath left the world during the present dispensation in a great measure under the power and will of men, so that things are not here below in the same perfect order as the things which are above….The free agency which he gave to his creatures necessitated that in some degree he should restrain his power and suffer the children of men to follow their own devices; yet nevertheless, since he has not vacated heaven, he is still master of earth, and can at any time gather up all the reins into his own hands.&lt;/blockquote&gt;We are given a certain responsibility to govern what goes on here, and this is why it’s our job to do God’s will, as well as to pray for God to do his will.  And at times we need to petition the Creator directly on behalf of his people.  We find in Amos 7:1-6 a beautiful example of this kind of intercession, which is the core of what I want to talk about here.<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;Thus the Lord GOD showed me: Behold, He formed locust swarms at the beginning of the late crop; indeed it was the late crop after the king’s mowings. And so it was, when they had finished eating the grass of the land, that I said:<br />    “O Lord GOD, forgive, I pray!<br />    Oh, that Jacob may stand,<br />    For he is small!”<br />    So the LORD relented concerning this.<br />    “It shall not be,” said the LORD.<br /><br />Thus the Lord GOD showed me: Behold, the Lord GOD called for conflict by fire, and it consumed the great deep and devoured the territory. Then I said:<br />    “O Lord GOD, cease, I pray!<br />    Oh, that Jacob may stand,<br />    For he is small!”<br />    So the LORD relented concerning this.<br />    “This also shall not be,” said the Lord GOD.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Amos asks God to cease his judgments, and he does.  First John 5:14-15 says, “Now this is the confidence that we have in Him, that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us. And if we know that He hears us, whatever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we have asked of Him.”  This means that when we pray for God to relent or to show mercy when he is in the process of passing judgment, we are not praying against his will, but we are praying for his will to come about, even though it might appear otherwise to our own finite minds.<br /><br />There are parallel incidents in Genesis 18:16-33, where Abraham intercedes for Sodom, and in Numbers 14:11-25, where Moses intercedes for the people of Israel.  Intercession in these passages about Abraham, Moses, and Amos, is all about relationship.  The Lord says, “Shall I hide from Abraham what I am doing?” (Gen. 18:17).  And adds, “For I have <i>known</i> him” (Gen. 18:19, emphasis mine).  This word “known” is the Hebrew word, <i>yada</i>, as in the Yiddish expression, “Yada, yada, yada.”  But it is also the same word used in Genesis 4:1, where it says, “Now Adam knew Eve his wife and she conceived and bore Cain…”  When God said he knew Abraham, it was the kind of knowledge and intimacy that two people share in marriage.   Our sovereign Lord, who declares the end from the beginning (see Isaiah 46:8-11), still chooses to partner with his people in a relational manner.<br /><br />In each of these cases, the Lord uses the dialog of the situation–the conflict, if you want to think of it in literary terms–to bring a deeper revelation of himself to his people.  He puts them to the test, to see how well they know his character, because it is through the challenge of our faith that our own faith becomes stronger.  And these men do, in fact, know the Lord’s character, and when they ask the Lord to cease and desist, they do it by reminding him of who he is.  Abraham says, “Far be it from You to do such a thing as this, to slay the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous should be as the wicked; far be it from You!  <i>Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?</i>” (Gen. 18:25, emphasis mine).  Moses asks God to “Pardon the iniquity of this people, I pray, <i>according to the greatness of Your mercy</i>, just as You have forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now” (Numbers 14:19, emphasis mine).<br /><br />When God spoke through the burning bush to call Moses in the desert, Moses gave numerous excuses on why he wasn’t the man for the job.  But God told him, “I will be with you” (Exodus 3:12).  When God gives you the call, don’t be like a child asked to take out the garbage and pretend you didn’t hear him.  And don’t just sit there and assume that someone else will come by and take care of it.<br /><br />“So I sought for a man among them who would make a wall, and stand in the gap before Me on behalf of the land, that I should not destroy it; but I found no one.  Therefore I have poured out my indignation on them…” (Ezekiel 22:30-31)  God has assigned the responsibility to us.  Will you take up the call?&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;<img width="1" height="1" src="" alt="" />&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <p>Christians are so uncool.  At least <i>Rolling Stone</i> thinks so.  They were going to run a story about down &amp; dirty street ministry on the Spanish island of Ibiza, but <i>RS</i> pulled the story, because apparently they’re <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/_/id/6635544" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mad at Christians</a> for getting Bush re-elected.

      <blockquote>I know, O LORD, that the way of man is not in himself,<br />that it is not in man who walks to direct his steps.<br />Correct me, O LORD, but in justice;<br />not in your anger, lest you bring me to nothing. (Jer 10:23-24, ESV)</blockquote>
<p>Jonathan Edwards wrote that cold results from the sun going below the horizon, yet the sun is a source of heat and not of cold, of light and not of darkness.  We do not blame the sun when we experience cold and darkness.  In the same way, “sin is not the fruit of any positive agency or influence of the Most High, but on the contrary, arises from the withholding of his action and energy, and under certain circumstances, necessarily follows on the want of his influence” (<a href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/edwards/works1.iii.v.ix.html"><i>The Works of Jonathan Edwards, Vol. 1</i></a>).<br /><br />A lot of people get tripped up and say, “How can God allow bad things to happen to good people?”  Well, as Jesus said, “No one is good except God alone” (Mk 10:18, ESV), and <i>if</i> there is any goodness in us, it comes from the Lord shining his warmth on us through the power of the Holy Spirit and the life of Christ that is in us.  “Therefore we were buried with Him through baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life” (Rom 6:4, NKJV).  This newness of life cannot be obtained any other way than through Jesus’ atoning sacrifice for our sins.<br /><br />As Romans 8:28 (NKJV) says, “And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose.”  We want him to call us according to his purpose.  We want him to work all things together for his good.  Since we are called according to his purpose, and since goodness results from exposure to God’s warmth, then it should be our desire for him to shine down his light and heat on us, unraveling the sin in our lives and replacing it with his righteous energy!<br /><br />Think of it as spiritual sunbathing…<br /><br />(Except instead of getting wrinkles and skin cancer, the result is that we begin to look more and more like Jesus!)&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;<img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2602771351651662379-5616849518063149973?l=mustfollow.blogspot.com" alt="" />&lt;/div&gt;</p>

Lewis</a> impersonates a Roman historian analyzing British culture, and he describes two distinct winter festivals that occur at the same time, yet which have two different themes that are not related to one another at all.  One is pagan and the other is Christian.  One involves a mad rush in which people exhaust themselves in the marketplace, and the other involves reverent worship.<br /><br />Lewis writes:<br /><br />&lt;blockquote&gt;But I myself conversed with a priest in one of these temples and asked him why they kept Crissmas on the same day as Exmas; for it appeared to me inconvenient.  But the priest replied, It is not lawful, O Stranger, for us to change the date of Crissmas, but would that Zeus would put it into the minds of the Niatirbians to keep Exmas at some other time or not to keep it at all.  For Exmas and the <i>Rush</i> distract the minds even of the few from sacred things.  And we indeed are glad that men should make merry at Crissmas; but in Exmas there is no merriment left.  And when I asked him why they endured the <i>Rush</i>, he replied, It is, O Stranger, a <i>racket</i>; using (as I suppose) the words of some oracle and speaking unintelligibly to me (for a <i>racket</i> is an instrument which the barbarians use in a game called <i>tennis</i>).&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br /><br />“Looking for baby Jesus under the trash” - <i>U2</i>.<br /><br />This morning, Rush Limbaugh made fun of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/05/opinion/05dowd.html?n=Top%2fOpinion%2fEditorials%20and%20Op%2dEd%2fOp%2dEd%2fColumnists%2fMaureen%20Dowd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maureen Dowd</a> for saying, “If I hear ‘Frosty the Snowman’ one more time, I’ll rip his frozen face off!”  Rush called her a joyless liberal.

      <h2><a href="/2004/12/05/thoughts-on-the-film-luther/">Thoughts on the Film /Luther/</a></h2>
      <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0002C9D9U/lbmusic"><img align="left" alt="Luther" border="0" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B0002C9D9U.01._SCMZZZZZZZ_.jpg" /></a> I rented <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0002C9D9U/lbmusic"><i>Luther</i></a> this weekend and watched it twice.  The opening credits proudly tout the name of the Lutheran bank that bankrolled the film (which I thought was kind of weird…  you never see B of A or Wells Fargo logos come up with the studio logos at the beginning of a movie).  The editing is poor and most of the actors have strange unidentifiable accents and deliver their lines in an awkward manner, with pauses in the wrong places (which is why I had to watch it twice and constantly rewind and use subtitles in order to catch much of the dialogue).  And there are some terrible overdubs where the actors on film are clearly not saying anything remotely close to what you hear out of your speakers.<br /><br />Also, the movie made it look like Luther died young, but he actually lived to the age of 62, which was a pretty descent lifespan in the 16th century.  Furthermore, many people are familiar with what Luther actually looked like, because several portraits are in existence, and he was definitely much more portly than the young Joseph Fiennes.  I don’t understand why Renée Zellweger <a href="http://www.greencine.com/list?action=viewList&amp;listID=4400" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gains</a> 30 pounds to play Bridget Jones and Martin Short dons a <a href="http://www.freep.com/entertainment/movies/pad24_20010724.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fat suit</a> for Primetime Glick, but Joseph Fiennes won’t do so much as stick a pillow under his shirt and put cotton balls in his cheeks.<br /><br />But despite all this, and also despite the lack of DVD extras, the film is still well worth seeing.  My favorite line is when the Augustinian abbot Johann von Staupitz tells Luther, “We preach best what we need to learn most.”  I <i>totally</i> identify with that.  If the church newsletter makes an impression on anyone in a certain week, you can bet that I was preaching to myself when I wrote it.<br /><br />The movie references <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&amp;passage=Matthew+16%3A16-18&amp;version=ESV" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew 16:16-18</a> and gives the foundational Protestant interpretation of what Jesus meant when he said, “On this rock I will build my church.”  But other than that, this film about the great reformer who said, “<i>Sola Scriptura!</i>” is seriously lacking in Scripture.  Probably the two most common things a Protestant lay churchgoer will hear about Luther deal with the book of Romans and the letter of James.  Romans, because it changed Luther’s life, and therefore the course of western civilization.  And James, because it’s the book that Luther wanted removed from the Canon of Scripture.  The movie mentioned neither of these points.<br /><br />They totally dropped the ball when it came to what at first glance appeared to be a fascinating cinematic portrayal of the scholar practicing Greek word studies.  In the film, Luther is working on his German translation of the New Testament, and he says, “Take this verse in Saint Luke–‘It is the Father’s will that nothing be lost.”  Actually, this is <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&amp;version=NKJV&amp;passage=John+6%3A39&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John 6:39</a>, and given the filmmakers’ affinity for A.D.R., you think they would have fixed it.  Joseph Fiennes goes on to describe the Greek word for ‘will’ as a “three-letter word” that “denotes passion, fire, inner organs”, etc.  In actuality, the Greek word used by our Lord Jesus in the passage is <i>thelema</i>, which, when spelled with the Greek letter theta, contains six letters.  And he couldn’t have meant that there are three letters in the German because the German word for ‘will’ contains five.<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;<i>Das ist aber der Wille des Vaters, der mich gesandt hat, daß ich nichts verliere von allem, was er mir gegeben hat, sondern daß ich’s auferwecke am Jüngsten Tage.</i> - Luther’s translation published 1545&lt;/blockquote&gt;So, if you’re one of those people who gets excited when a famous Hollywood actor stars in a film with spiritual subject matter (like me), don’t get <i>too</i> excited.  Mel Gibson might be a papist, but he certainly treats the Holy Bible with a little more reverence and awe in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00028HBKM/lbmusic"><i>The Passion</i></a>.<br /><br />Despite the scene I just described, the film does hold God’s word in its proper place theologically when the actors are talking about it (just not when they quote it or reference it directly).  It is Luther’s exposure to Scripture that changes his life, not his monastic vows or his participation in Catholic rites.  When he is on trial before the emperor, he says he will not recant unless he is shown that he is wrong <i>through Scripture</i>.  Luther’s efforts to provide a German translation are accurately treated.  And when Prince Frederick the Wise–extremely well-played by the late Sir Peter Ustinov (who played Herod the Great in Franco Zeffirelli’s <a href="http://www.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=2602771351651662379&amp;postID=3039143305317076806">Jesus of Nazareth</a>)– receives his gift of a German New Testament from Luther, the scene is appropriately handled as the focal point, what the whole thing is all about.  And what’s great is that Frederick doesn’t treat it like another sacred relic to add to his massive collection (which he wisely decided to pack up and put in storage after being impacted by Luther’s preaching), but he handles it gently and opens it and begins reading it.<br /><br />We go to a church that is all about getting people into God’s Word.  We go through it verse by verse on Sunday morning and Wednesday night, and we even have a Bible college that provides bachelor’s degrees and school of ministry certificates as well as audit programs so that laypeople can study the Word more deeply.  And there are churches all over the world where they do the same thing.  But sadly, there are still so many Christians who do not experience the life-changing benefits that come from personal Bible study and daily Bible reading.  Without a knowledge of history, it is easy for people to be ignorant of the fact that so many people gave their lives in order for you to have the right to read the Bible for yourself.  Even today in Asia and the Middle East, people are losing their lives trying to give common people access to God’s word.  Please don’t take God’s word for granted.  <i>Treasure</i> the Gospel!&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <h2><a href="/2004/12/03/the-paradox-of-honesty/">The Paradox of Honesty</a></h2>
      <blockquote>This is the message we have heard from him and proclaim to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.  If we say we have fellowship with him while we walk in darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth.  But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin.  If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.  If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.  If we say we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us." - 1 Jn 1:5-10 (ESV)</blockquote>
<p>There is an interesting paradox in the Gospel.  I was thinking about the paradox last night, and then I opened my Bible to 1 John and saw it right there.  The paradox is that you have to not be sinful: yet, you have to admit that you’re sinful.  If you’re sinful, you can’t be in His presence: but if you say you’re not sinful, you’re lying.  You have to be good: but you have to admit that you’re bad.<br /><br />The good news is that our access to the King is based upon redemption and adoption.  It’s all about His grace, not about our own righteousness.  This is why a religious practice that is based on pretending is so extremely dangerous.  Practicing religion based on external appearance is hypocritical.  In order to avoid hypocrisy, honesty should be the most important attribute of our daily Christian walk.<br /><br />I don’t have kids, but I grew up with a Dad who’s a worship leader (and when I was a teenager I was mad at him a lot).  So I like what Chuck Swindoll said about honesty in <i>The Grace Awakening</i> (p. 101):<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;When you blow it, say, “I blew it.”  If you don’t know, admit the truth.  It’s okay not to know.  And the next time your kids spot hypocrisy, even though you may feel embarrassed, agree with them, “You know what, kids?  You’re right.  I was a first-class hypocrite.  What you saw and pointed out is exactly right.”  Tell them that.  It may sound embarrassing to you now, but they will admire and respect your admission.  And they won’t grow up damaged.  Best of all, they will learn to model the same kind of vulnerability and honesty, even if you are in vocational Christian work . . . <i>especially if you’re in vocational Christian work</i>.  Nobody expects perfection, but they do and they should expect honesty.&lt;/blockquote&gt;(The principle goes beyond just parents and children and should apply to other relationships as well.)&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;<img width="1" height="1" src="" alt="" />&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <p><i><b>DISCLAIMER!</b> This post no longer accurately reflects my theology.  But I am keeping it here for posterity.  Of great concern to me is the Arminian notion of free will which I claimed was bestowed on us at salvation, whereas the truth is, my will is still not free, and I am entirely dependent upon the Holy Spirit to keep me walking in his steps.</i><br />&lt;blockquote&gt;<i>Let Thy goodness, like a fetter,<br />Bind my wandering heart to Thee.<br />Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it,<br />Prone to leave the God I love;<br />Here’s my heart, O take and seal it,<br />Seal it for Thy courts above.</i>&lt;/blockquote&gt;<i>And that malarkey about “God is a Gentleman”– I’m so embarrassed…</i><br /><br /><i>Original post:</i><br />&lt;blockquote&gt;Come now, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will go to such and such a city, spend a year there, buy and sell, and make a profit”; whereas you do not know what will happen tomorrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapor that appears for a little time and then vanishes away. Instead you ought to say, “If the Lord wills, we shall live and do this or that.” But now you boast in your arrogance. All such boasting is evil. Therefore, to him who knows to do good and does not do it, to him it is sin. (James 4:13-17, NKJV)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;But if serving the LORD seems undesirable to you, then choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve, whether the gods your forefathers served beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you are living. But as for me and my household, we will serve the LORD. (Joshua 24:15, NIV)&lt;/blockquote&gt;Some Christians can mistakenly get caught up in a view of God’s sovereignty that says that, if God is in control, then His will is going to happen in my life, just by my continued existence, so I can sit back and relax and do what I want.  But as justified, regenerated believers, He has bestowed upon us a free will.  There are now two wills at work in us, the will of the old man (the flesh) and the will of the new man (led by the Spirit).  We have to actively decide which of these we are going to let govern our lives.  That is, God, as the Gentleman He is, will not force His will on us.  His will is something we need to choose for ourselves.<br /><br />God’s word tells us over and over again that we need to do His will.  In Matthew 7:21 (ESV), Jesus says, “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.”  See also Mt 12:50; Mk 3:35; Jn 4:34, 7:17, 9:31; Eph 6:6; Heb 10:36; 1 Jn 2:17.  If it were not required of us to choose to do His will, then we would not have to be told.<br /><br />We are also told to seek His will, to know His will, and to choose His will over our own. Jesus said, “I can do nothing on my own. As I hear, I judge, and my judgment is just, because I seek not my own will but the will of him who sent me” (John 5:30, ESV).  See also Mt 26:42; Lk 12:47, 22:42; Jn 6:38; Acts 22:14; Rom 12:2; Eph 5:17; Col 1:9; Heb 10:7; 1 Pe 4:2-3.<br /><br />There are two imporant points here.  First: His will is in fact knowable, and second: His will is EMPHATICALLY not the same as our will.  If we believe that God’s sovereignty means that, because He’s in control, we can just follow our every whim and thereby produce God’s will in our lives, we are wrong.  And many of us have learned this the hard way (for Biblical examples of guys to do it the hard way, look at the life of Jacob in Genesis, and the life of Solomon in 2 Chronicles and Ecclesiastes).<br /><br />Our will is bad; God’s will is good.  We have to actively choose to submit ourselves to God (James 4:1-10).  So, how do we know what God’s will is in order that we might choose it?  Read the Bible and pray.  Those are the two primary means through which God reveals His will to us: through His word, and through prayer.<br /><br />Through His word, He tells us directly what His will is.  First of all, it is His will for us to be saved: “Even so it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish” (Mt 18:14, NKJV). See also John 6:39-40, Gal 1:4, Eph 1:5, 1:9-12, Heb 10:9-10.  Scripture also tells us in several places that His will is for us to be sanctified, to abstain from sexual immorality (1 Th 4:3), to control our bodies and honor our spouses as well “in sanctification and honor” (1 Th 4:4), to not be a slave of your own desires like those who do not know God (1 Th 4:5, see also Eph 2:1-7), to be thankful in all things (1 Thess. 5:18), and to do good and silence the ignorant (1 Pe 2:15).  Each of these verses contains the phrase, “This is the will of God.”  But we can be sure that wherever there is an imperative in the Scripture, and the context of the passage makes it applicable to all believers, that is God’s will for us.  We should always read God’s Word in such a way that we’re seeking how it can be applied in our lives.<br /><br />As for the subject of prayer, the relationship between prayer and God’s will is multifaceted.  First of all, we pray for His will to be done: Mt 6:10, Luke 11:2.  Also, we pray for His will to be revealed to us: Col 1:9, 4:12.  And we can pray in the confidence “that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us” (1 John 5:14).  Again, remember that His will is different from our will.  We do not pray for our desires, we pray for His desires in us (see James 4:3).  C.S. Lewis, as portrayed in the movie <i>Shadowlands</i>, says, “I pray because I can’t help myself. I pray because I’m helpless. I pray because the need flows out of me all the time, waking and sleeping. It doesn’t change God, it changes me.”<br /><br />Prayer actually “bends our <i>wills</i> to God’s will” (Hughes, <i>Disciplines of a Godly Man</i>, 83). E. Stanley Jones said, “If I throw out a boathook from the boat and catch hold of the shore and pull, do I pull the shore to me, or do I pull myself to the shore?  Prayer is not pulling God to my will, but the aligning of my will to the will of God” (<i>A Song of Ascents</i>, 383).<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;Now may the God of peace who brought up our Lord Jesus from the dead, that great Shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant, make you complete in every good work to do His will, working in you what is well pleasing in His sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen. (Heb 13:20-21, NKJV)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;<img width="1" height="1" src="" alt="" />&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <p>…Actually, all the time.<br /><br />“So then it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who shows mercy.” Romans 9:16 (NKJV)<br /><br />One of the hardest lessons for a Christian–even an old, experienced one–to internalize is the reality of the gospel of Grace: the fact that we can’t make it on our own. Obviously, that’s the reason we turned to Jesus in the first place, because we realized that we couldn’t make it on our own, that we need His help, His redeeming love, His atonement for our sins, His Spirit at work in our lives to make us new creatures. But sometimes we lose focus and fail to “keep the main thing the main thing.” We start to focus on our own self- righteousness and compare ourselves with other people, and we forget that it’s not about our will or our desire, or our running or striving, but it’s about the Lord’s mercy.<br /><br />Galatians 3:3 (ESV) “Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh?”<br /><br />The struggle between legalism and liberty is a struggle between the flesh and the spirit, and we have to recognize that. By adhering to a strict code of dos and don’ts, I’m actually operating in the flesh rather than the Spirit and giving strength to my carnal man–the sinful nature–rather than the reborn spirit He’s given me. Legalism feeds the flesh and kills our spiritual life just as much as sinful indulgence does.<br /><br />True holiness looks similar to legalism on the outside, but its motivation is different, and its attitude towards other people is different. If we become puffed up in our pride and start condemning other people for not being like us, then we cheapen God’s grace. We say, in effect, “God’s grace is enough for a good person like me, but not for a rotten scoundrel like you. If you want God to bless you, you better shape up, mister!” But only Jesus can make us shape up, and the only way we can get others to shape up is by evidencing the Spirit at work in our hearts, shaping us up from the inside out, and leaving room for the Holy Spirit to do the same in their lives. When others see grace at work in us, they will want it for themselves as well.<br /><br />For those of us who are getting together with family during this season, I pray that we would remember to keep the main thing the main thing. Show grace to your brothers and sisters (or aunts, uncles, cousins, parents, grandparents, nieces, nephews, second cousin twice removed, etc.), show them the love that Jesus showed us. Let them see His Spirit at work in our hearts. Lord, let us trade in our hearts of stone for hearts of flesh. Give us a softness and a vulnerability that will help us show our family how infinitely valuable your grace is!<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;Listen to me now<br />I need to let you know<br />You don’t have to go it alone<br /><br />- <i>U2, “Sometimes You Can’t Make it on Your Own”</i>&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;<img width="1" height="1" src="" alt="" />&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <h2><a href="/2004/11/19/faith-like-a-book/">Faith Like a Book</a></h2>
      <p>“Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.” (Hebrews 11:1, NKJV)<br /><br />It is by faith that God’s purposes are realized (made real) in our lives. If you look at the ‘Hall of Faith’ (Hebrews 11), from Abel to the prophets, you see that it’s faith that creates the next link in the chain of God’s redemptive history. It’s faith that enables the next step in the ladder. It’s faith that paves the way for those to follow. These all were following the Lord, looking forward to the hope, yet not fully understanding exactly what God was going to do. Abraham “went out, not knowing where he was going” (v. 8), “for he waited for the city which has foundations, whose builder and maker is God” (v. 10).<br /><br />And so faith is closely linked with God’s sovereign plans. God’s sovereignty is what Hebrews 11 looks like from eternity’s perspective (it’s not really mentioned in the chapter, but you can see God’s hand at work throughout). Faith is what it looks like to us, while we’re still walking, because we don’t know the end from the beginning. We can read Hebrews 11 and see how it all makes sense now. But Abraham, Moses, Joshua, David, et al., didn’t know exactly how their lives would fit into God’s redemptive plan. They were walking by faith.<br /><br />Faith for us in the present means looking to the future, while standing on the solid foundation of the evidence we have of God’s past faithfulness. Each of those guys in Hebrews 11 had to go through the same thing, trusting God, that he was faithful in the past, so he will be faithful in the future.<br /><br />Henry Ford said, “History is bunk.” Napoleon said, “History is a fable.” But we know better. History is what faith looks like after the fact. History is God’s story, written before the foundations of the world.<br /><br />Hebrews 12:2 says Jesus is the author of our faith. And so faith is like reading a book. The moment we call ‘Now’ is where the bookmark is (or the sentence we’re currently on). History is everything we already read. It makes sense to a certain extent, but the story’s not finished yet and there are some loose ends that need to be tied up. The future is everything we haven’t read yet. And faith is the act of reading, pressing on to the next sentence, turning the page, knowing that the Author is good and that when you reach the end, you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Time is a continuous link of consecutive ‘presents’. The moment that I wrote this sentence is now past, but once it was present. The moment you first read this sentence is now present, but now it is past. The future is the same way, just in the opposite order. Walk by faith in God’s promises–what He said, He will do. It’s already been written. You just haven’t read it yet. :-)<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;His purposes will ripen fast,<br />unfolding every hour;<br />The bud may have a bitter taste,<br />but sweet will be the flower.<br /><br /><i>- William Cowper, “God Moves in a Mysterious Way”</i>&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;<img width="1" height="1" src="" alt="" />&lt;/div&gt;</p>

      <h2><a href="/2004/11/12/jacobs-presumption/">Jacob&#8217;s Presumption</a></h2>
      <p>Jacob, the grandson of Abraham and father of the twelve tribes of Israel, journeyed to his uncle’s land in search of a bride in the same way Abraham’s servant was sent to retrieve Rebekah.  On his way, he has a dream in which the Lord shows him a ladder between heaven and earth, prophetically symbolizing that the Messiah will come through his lineage, bridging the gap between God and man created by the fall of Adam.  (In John 1:51, NKJV, the Savior says, “You shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.”)<br /><br />It’s important to note that Jacob is not yet fully committed to the Lord at this point.  He contemplates it, and strikes a bargain with God.<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;Then Jacob made a vow, saying, “If God will be with me, and keep me in this way that I am going, and give me bread to eat and clothing to put on, so that I come back to my father’s house in peace, then the LORD shall be my God. And this stone which I have set as a pillar shall be God’s house, and of all that You give me I will surely give a tenth to You. (Gen. 28:20-22, NKJV)&lt;/blockquote&gt;    It’s as if he’s saying, <i>Look, Lord, I’m going to Haran, and I’m going to do whatever I want there, but if you bless me while I do whatever I want, then I’ll serve you religiously when I get home, tithing and all, okay?</i><br /><br />God blessed Jacob despite his ignorance and presumptuous approach to worship.  But God had some hard lessons to teach him.  Do not assume that if God is blessing you as you do your own thing, that it means he’s condoning your behavior and that you’re in his favor.  On our road to sanctification, it is God’s goal to kill our flesh and any self-contained strength that would keep us operating on our own and seeking our own way.  He wants to put our hip out of joint and give us a limp so we cannot walk without assistance.  God wants us to come to him with “a broken spirit, a broken and a contrite heart” (Ps 51:17).  He wants to change us, to make us like his Son, and his Son said he didn’t do anything he didn’t first see his Father doing.  “If you’ve seen me, you’ve seen the Father.”<br /><br />God is more concerned about the internal process and the position of our hearts than the results.  Abraham’s servant prayed for God to show him specifically who he was supposed to bring for Isaac.  Jacob merely copied the externals, thinking, perhaps, <i>Grandfather’s servant picked the first girl he saw at the well, so that must mean it will be the same way for me…</i>  But, unlike Abraham’s servant, Jacob didn’t sit down and pray for the Lord’s direction, giving him glory each step of the way.<br /><br />Jacob took the blessing of Bethel for granted.  You may have God’s blessing on your life, you may know that he has called you for a certain purpose.  Maybe you’re a worship leader or a teacher or a missionary, and you know that God’s going to use you to “bless the Gentiles.”  But recognize that submission to God’s will is a <i>continual</i> act, a <i>continuous</i> internal bowing of our hearts to the Lord.  We need to live our lives in humility, empowered by the Holy Spirit.  We cannot operate in our lives as if we have a divine mandate, and yet forget to open our written authorization to see what his directions are.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;<img width="1" height="1" src="" alt="" />&lt;/div&gt;</p>
