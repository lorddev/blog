<p class="view">by Aaron Lord</p>

<p>This from <a href="http://www.sfpulpit.com/2009/01/16/clarifying-calvinism-part-5/">Phil Johnson</a> in his <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style:italic;">Clarifying Calvinism</span> series:&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;For some reason, from my earliest childhood, hearing the chorus of that song, that had always struck me as a pretty lousy reason for loving Jesus. Of course, in my unregenerate state, I had almost no understanding whatsoever of the love of Christ for me. I knew that He loved me and I was <em>supposed</em> to love Him, because we sang about it and all. But loving Him just because He loved me first didn’t seem like a particularly noble or admirable reason for loving Him. In fact it always sounded a little bit childish, because it was the very same reason I always gave my mother when she asked me why I hit my brother: <em>Because he hit me first!</em>&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Posted on the <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style:italic;"><a href="http://www.sfpulpit.com/2009/01/16/clarifying-calvinism-part-5/">Pulpit Magazine</a></span><a href="http://www.sfpulpit.com/2009/01/16/clarifying-calvinism-part-5/"> blog</a>.<br />&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</p>
