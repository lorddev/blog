<p>I came across this in my morning devotions:</p>
<blockquote>I perceived that whatever God does endures forever, nothing can be added to it, nor anything taken from it. God has done it, so that people fear before him. That which is, already has been; that which is to be, already has been; and God seeks what has been driven away.</blockquote>
