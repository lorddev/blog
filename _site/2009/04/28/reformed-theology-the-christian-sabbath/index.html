This is core to the exegetical task: When God said something in the Old Testament, we look at what he said about it in the New Testament.  We try to interpret Scripture with Scripture to come to a better understanding of the whole counsel of God.  For example, in coming to Scripture in this way, we can see that it is okay to eat pork because of Peter&#39;s vision in Acts 10.  We must do the same with the fourth commandment and come to it the way Jesus explained it, and not the way the Pharisees explained it. &quot;whoever relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven...&quot; (see Mt. 5:17-19, ESV)" />
