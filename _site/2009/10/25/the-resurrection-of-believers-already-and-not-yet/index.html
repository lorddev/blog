<h1>The Resurrection of Believers: Already and Not Yet</h1>

<p class="view">by Aaron Lord</p>

<p>Richard Gaffin, quoted by Rev. Kim Riddlebarger in <span style="font-style:italic;">A Case for Amillenialism:</span></p>
<blockquote>The unity of the resurrection of Christ and the resurrection of believers is such that the latter consists of two episodes in the experience of the individual believer—one which is already past, already realized [e.g. <a href="http://www.gnpcb.org/esv/search/?q=Colossians+2">Col. 2:12</a>: “having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the powerful working of God, who raised him from the dead”], and one which is future, yet to be realized [e.g. <a href="http://www.gnpcb.org/esv/search/?q=Colossians+3">Col. 3:4</a>: “When Christ who is your life appears, then you also will appear with him in glory.”]. In the period between the resurrection and the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=LJ1c9We_ay8C&amp;lpg=PA992&amp;ots=fLYX6KtSZm&amp;dq=bible%20dictionary%20parousia&amp;pg=PA992#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false">Parousia</a> of Christ, any believer is one who has already been raised from the dead, and is yet to be raised. . . . The distinctive notion that the <span style="font-style:italic;">eschatos</span>, the “age-to-come,” is both present and future, is reflected in [Paul’s] teaching concerning the fundamental eschatological occurrence for the individual believer: his resurrection is both already and not yet.
