This is what we saw in the parable. The crash of Flight 1549 illustrates God’s right and power to judge. The landing of the plane represents God’s mercy. It was God’s call to all the passengers and all their families and all who heard the story to repent and turn to God’s Son, Jesus Christ, and receive forgiveness for sin.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I strongly encourage you to read this article and pass it along.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
