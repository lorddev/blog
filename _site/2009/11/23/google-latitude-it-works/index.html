<p>When Latitude was first released for the iPhone as a web app, I was  <br />unimpressed, because it appeared to be using the cell-tower- <br />triangulation method of finding your location rather than the GPS  <br />coordinates. But I loaded it up today, and it's 100% accurate even as  <br />I walk down the street!&lt;p&gt;I don't know if they fixed a bug, or whether this was caused by an  <br />erronneous setting on AT&amp;T's end that caused their system to think  <br />that my new iPhone 3G was actually my old first-generation iPhone (we  <br />got that straightened out after MMS went live).&lt;p&gt;Sent from my iPhone&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;<img width="1" height="1" src="" alt="" />&lt;/div&gt;</p>
