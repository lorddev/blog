Here's a quote:&lt;p&gt;“More than conventional: scholars who are attuned to the Christian  <br />element in Shakespeare's plays correctly observe that there is  <br />sometimes a gratuitous element in Shakespeare's Christian allusions,  <br />meaning that Shakespeare incorporates Christian references beyond what  <br />seem to be strictly required by the context.”&lt;p&gt;You can find it here: <a href="http://www.reformation21.org/articles/shakespeare-as-a-christian-writer.php">http://www.reformation21.org/articles/shakespeare-as-a-christian-writer.php</a>&lt;p&gt;I highly recommed reading the whole thing.&lt;p&gt;HT: JT @ <a href="http://theologica.blogspot.com/">http://theologica.blogspot.com/</a>&lt;p&gt;Sent from my iPhone&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</p>
