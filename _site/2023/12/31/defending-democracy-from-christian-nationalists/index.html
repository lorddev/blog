<p>I am reading <a href="https://bookwyrm.social/book/1462496/s/defending-democracy-from-its-christian-enemies">Defending Democracy from its Christian Enemies</a>, by David P. Gushee, which has been recommended by Kristin Kobes Du Mez, author of <a href="https://bookwyrm.social/book/95018/s/jesus-and-john-wayne">Jesus and John Wayne</a>. Despite the cutting title, it’s a book written by a Christian, for Christians.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On page 144 we have gotten past secular analysis of “authoritarian reactionary Christianity” in the last few hundred years of history and are moving on to an apologetic of why Baptists have preferred and should prefer democracy over a dictatorship. That’s where the above quote shows up.</p>
