<h1>The Dabbling Imagination</h1>

<p class="view">by Aaron Lord</p>

<p>I seem to have a better outlook on life when I am allowed to apply for other jobs. Whether those jobs pan out doesn’t seem to matter as much as you’d think; somehow the benefits that the realm of possibilities brings to my imagination seem to outweigh the pain of any rejections that might occur in the process.</p>

<p>So, if you find yourself as my employer and find me seemingly looking for work elsewhere, fret not. Yes, there is a chance I’m dissatisfied and looking to better my situation, or there’s a chance I’m trying to build up a network for freelance jobs. But there’s also a chance I’m just participating in a mental health exercise, trying to boost my own confidence by dabbling in the job market so I can restore some sanity and come back to work the next day with a brighter smile, and a glimmer of hope that maybe life isn’t a dead end after all.</p>
