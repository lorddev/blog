<h1>Blogging Church Discipline</h1>

<p class="view">by Aaron Lord</p>

<p>I became a fan of Lee Irons because of his work (with the late Meredith Kline) developing the the Framework interpretation of the first three chapters of Genesis. Irons was later censured by the Orthodox Presbyterian Church. He has thorough documented his case online, most recently with a blog about his <a href="http://upper-register.typepad.com/blog/2011/12/complaint-denied-by-pca-standing-judicial-commission.html">successful ordination</a> as ruling elder at a PCA church.</p>

<p>This got me wondering whether I should go into greater detail about our own church discipline experience. I admit I don’t have as much documentation as Irons does, at least when it comes to the exoneration part. It was more of a verbal relenting…</p>
