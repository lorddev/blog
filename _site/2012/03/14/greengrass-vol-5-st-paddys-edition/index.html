<meta name="description" content="I&#39;ve gone all-celtic for this special St. Patrick&#39;s Day edition, which includes a lot of punk rock to boost your energy for those all-day &amp; all-night college-town parties. We&#39;ll start off with &quot;Shipping Up to Boston&quot; by Boston&#39;s own Dropkick Murphys. This tune was a big hit for them, and was used in a couple movie soundtracks. With very few words, it can be thought of as an instrumental and an anthem at the same time. &quot;If I Should Fall From Grace With God&quot; (The Pogues) - This is the title track from their third album, produced by Steve Lillywhite in 1988. This was their best-selling album, topping off at #3 on the UK charts. It&#39;s my favorite, too. &quot;Ward&#39;s Favorite/The Morning Star,&quot; etc. (Celtic Fiddle Festival) - No, it’s not a fiddle camp; it’s not even a compilation: it’s a band! I’ve long been a fan of Kevin Burke… This was recorded live and you can hear the hootin&#39; and hollerin&#39; as the set builds. &quot;Dillon&#39;s Fancy/Maids in the Meadow/Toss the Feathers&quot; (Kevin Crawford) - Crawford is the frontman for Irish group Lúnasa, this was recorded a few years before that group&#39;s inception. &quot;The Rare Ould Times&quot; (Flogging Molly) - Here&#39;s a number from Molly Malone&#39;s darling house band. A song from the 1970s first recorded by the Dublin City Ramblers. Characteristically, Flogging Molly start this tune like a ballad and turn it into something quite different. &quot;The Rocky Road to Dublin&quot; (The Tossers) - Chicago&#39;s The Tossers provide an energetic angst to this Irish classic. The Tossers are great, as they&#39;re technically classified as Celtic punk even though they only use traditional acoustic instrumentation. &quot;Billy&#39;s Bones&quot; (The Pogues) - From their second studio album, this is a Shane MacGowan romper. &quot;And there&#39;s mothers cryin&#39; all over this world…for their poor dead darling boys and girls.&quot; &quot;The Morning Dew&quot; (Peatbog Faeries) - Okay, I admit, Peatbog Faeries are a Scottish band, but this is an Irish song, so there. It&#39;s a great reel in E-minor. Martin Hayes also has a great version of it on The Lonesome Touch. &quot;The Irish Rover&quot; (Dropkick Murphys) - Another Irish classic, the Murphys make it a little bit louder. I&#39;m super surprises they didn&#39;t record it until their seventh album! &quot;Swagger&quot; (Flogging Molly) - Their instrumental hit featuring Bridget Regan&#39;s fiddle, it&#39;s a great selection for a St. Paddy&#39;s mix. &quot;The Parting Glass&quot; (The Pogues) - From their second album, this minor-key cover of a classic Irish ballad has a slightly disturbing twinge to it, almost like a mechanical dirge. &quot;Heroes From Our Past&quot; (Dropkick Murhpys) - Time for a rocking working-class anthem with plenty of pipes! &quot;The Chorus Reel/Ashmolean House&quot; (Jerry O&#39;Sullivan) - Some reels on uilleann pipes with Seamus Eagan on banjo. &quot;The Dear Irish Boy&quot; (Willie Clancy) - An air from one of the most famous uilleann pipers of the 20th century. &quot;Shane Bradley&quot; (The Pogues) - A beautiful instrumental composed by Shane MacGowan, this tune appears on If I Should Fall from Grace with God. We&#39;ll close with a pretty rockin&#39; version &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; by DKM… Sláinte! P.S. Don&#39;t drive drunk." />
