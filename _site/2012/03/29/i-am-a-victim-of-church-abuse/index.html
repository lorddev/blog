<p>I am a victim of church abuse.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a poor and young church musician in the late 1990s, I was taken advantage of and guilt-tripped into serving to the point of exhaustion. You may blame my own stupidity for this, but no pastors actually took me aside to explain the concept of free grace. During a time of unemployment I was told by a pastor I had to tithe on my tiny unemployment checks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was a devoted staff member at another church for several years and was fired without cause, and without warning. Later I was told by other pastors who were "wondering where I had been" that they expected me to continue going there and serving in the music ministry, for free. It makes me think of the line in <em>The Godfather—</em> "It's not personal, it's business." But how are you not supposed to take it personally when your livelihood depends on your work?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Years later my wife and I were horribly mistreated at a church we had helped to plant, simply for exercising our rights as members to be the only dissenting votes in the matter of a constitutional change which would have actually prevented our own eligibility for ministry. As Secretary of the Board, I had made several recommendations about this constitutional change. We were bullied before the vote as they tried to bring us in line, and then put under discipline after it, even though we had already resigned our membership. Congregational polity is an illusion when you demand unanimity through bullying.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a result I have come to deeply appreciate Presbyterian polity. It is good to have the accountability that is provided by a plurality of elders as well as inter-congregational councils (synods, presbyteries, general assemblies, etc.). I also appreciate churches that actually require seminary training, rather than just ordaining anybody with charisma who can say, "The word 'therefore' is there for a reason."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These are a few of those details which <a href="/blog/2012/02/28/i-have-issues-with/" title="">I mentioned</a> I had "only vaguely alluded to." I think I've been less specific about such things in the past, but there is a growing online community of like-minded people who are coming out about their own situations. It's made me a little bit braver, but I think it has also inspired me to want to speak out in a way that could actually bring encouragement <em>to them.</em> It helps me to know they're there, but I hope it would help them to know there are others of us, as well.</p>

<li>Lee Irons (whom I credit with exposing me to the Framework Theory) was <a href="http://www.upper-register.com/about.html">censured</a> by the Orthodox Presbyterian Church because his wife Misty had written some articles about how the idea of homosexuality <em>not</em> being a choice was completely <a href="http://www.upper-register.com/irons_trial/musingson/Doc05.April-02.NTJ.html">compatible</a> with a Calvinistic doctrine of Original Sin. ("None of us have been able to choose away all of our own sins," she <a href="http://www.musingson.com/ccCase.html">wrote</a>) When Irons refused to exercise his so-called God-given authority as the "head" of his wife and force her to recant, they kicked him out. He has provided extensive documentation of his case.</li>

<li><a href="http://biologos.org/blog">Biologos</a> - This resource has been so helpful to me since I started down this path a few years ago. It was founded by Francis Collins, who was the first to decode the human genome, who left Biologos to become head of the NIH. The mission of Biologos is to promote the fact that faith and science are not incompatible. In addition to regular posts from scientists in various fields, their blog also features posts from the likes of <a href="http://biologos.org/blog/creation-evolution-and-christian-laypeople-part-1">Tim Keller</a> and <a href="https://biologos.org/articles/n-t-wright-on-scripture-and-the-authority-of-god">N.T.

<li>I've linked to it <a href="https://www.devlord.io/blog/2011/06/10/the-marks-of-an-abusive-church/">before</a>, but it's worth doing it again. Ronald M. Enroth's book <em>Churches That Abuse</em> is available <a href="http://www.ccel.us/churches.toc.html">online in its entirety</a>. I used <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instapaper/id288545208">Instapaper</a> to read the whole thing, and I was quite amazed as I found I could relate to almost every single chapter.</li>
