<h1>MR10: Runner&#8217;s World Editor&#8217;s Choice</h1>

<p class="view">by Aaron Lord</p>

<p>The New Balance MR10 (Minimus Road) was recently named International Editor’s Choice for minimalist running shoe by Runner’s World, even though New Balance is coming out with a new model in March.</p>

<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/20120219-145322.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/20120219-145322.jpg" alt="20120219-145322.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>I’ve put 90 miles on my pair in the last 2 months, and they’re already seeing signs of wear and tear. The midsoles are separating from the upper near the metatarsal joints where they bend. I had high hopes for these shoes, but I’m sad to say, they’re not the best choice for distance running. Even the more minimalist MT10 (or the winterized MO10 in my case) seems to perform better over longer distances, despite having less padding. I don’t know whether it’s that they’re roomier in the toe box than their trail-equipped siblings, or that the extra cushioning actually creates more friction against the toes. But I always end up with a lot of foot pain after about 6 miles in them (which was less than half the distance I ran in them this morning).</p>

<p>I really do like these shoes, though, and they perform quite well over short distances. Last weekend I wore them when I set a personal record in a 5K and placed second in my age group (my first time placing). My arches were kind of sore for a few days, but I took that as a good sign that they we being exercised properly. It’s ironic that they perform well for short distances, when the reason people typically reach for increased cushioning (over minimal trail shoes) is to provide the extra padding for the long haul. Oh well. Now I’ll just have to spend the next two weeks before the half marathon deciding whether to go with my MO10s or my old, well-worn Saucony Kinvara 2s.</p>
