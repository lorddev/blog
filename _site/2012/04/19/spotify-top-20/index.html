<h1>Spotify Top 20</h1>

<p class="view">by Aaron Lord</p>

<p>Here’s something you might not know about me: I hate pop radio. I prefer the kind of music that just won’t pull in the ratings they need to sell the ads. So you might be surprised to see me publishing a Spotify top 20 chart.</p>

<p>But Spotify certainly has a different demographic from pop radio—like techno geeks with iOS devices and money to spare for subscriptions. Still, there were a lot of tunes on Spotify’s charts that ended up being kind of crappy. So I took the Top 40 and eliminated 20 of the less awesome tracks. It’s a good opportunity for discovery, with new releases by Jason Mraz, singles from Iceland’s Of Monsters and Men, as well as some tunes from Mumford and Sons and Florence + the Machine. You might still find yourself skipping some tracks, but it’s going to be a lot less offensive to your ears than the unedited top 40.</p>
