<h1>Cloud-based Visual Studio 6.0 IDE with IE 8</h1>

<p class="view">by Aaron Lord</p>

<p>I've created an Amazon EC2 AMI disk image with Visual Studio 6.0/Interdev installed on it (SP 6). This product is no longer supported by Microsoft. Since I took the time to find the installer and get a version up and running I thought it would be helpful if I let others use it as well. The AMI ID is ami-60163025. You can search for it in the EC2 console's AMIs under "public images" for Windows. It's in the West/Northern California zone.</p>
