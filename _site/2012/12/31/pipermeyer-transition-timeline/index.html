<h1>Piper/Meyer transition timeline</h1>

<p class="view">by Aaron Lord</p>

<p>Due to sub-par search engine optimization on the part of Bethlehem Baptist's own <a href="http://hopeingod.org">website</a>, my blog has somehow become the source for all things John Piper—at least when it relates to the subject of his retirement from pastoral ministry. So I've gone ahead and found a copy of Bethlehem's <a href="http://www.hopeingod.org/news-events/bethlehem-blogs/bethlehem-updates-blog/timeline-transition-pastor-preaching-vision">transition timeline</a> so I could place a <a href="http://www.hopeingod.org/news-events/bethlehem-blogs/bethlehem-updates-blog/timeline-transition-pastor-preaching-vision">link here</a> where it would be easier for people to find it.</p>
<p>According to the timeline, Jason Meyer would have preached the recent advent series before the holiday break, and starting yesterday has taken up regular preaching duties until his installation in April 2013.</p>
<p>(Also see Piper's <a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/blog/posts/my-future-at-desiring-god">blog post at Desiring God</a> from last April.)</p>
