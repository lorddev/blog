<h1>Romney’s Weekly Blunder</h1>

<p class="view">by Aaron Lord</p>

<p>The downward spiral is just accelerating for this guy.</p>

<p>A month ago he sided with the birthers with his racist “no one’s asking for <em>my</em> birth certificate” remark. Before that were all the issues with Paul Ryan’s <em>War on Women</em>. Then he just sucked at the RNC. And I think Clinton’s “It’s the Arithmetic, Stupid!” speech just kicked his ass.</p>

<p>Last week Romney attacked our foreign service agents accusing them of “apologizing for America”, siding with bigoted hatemongers instead of keeping his politics onshore like he should have.</p>

<p>But <a href="http://youtu.be/XnB0NZzl5HA">this video</a> basically makes the guy unelectable. He’s accusing the middle class, the infirm, etc. of being lazy. And lots of so-called “Christians” will vote for him regardless. Even though the Bible says all over the place that we should pay our workers a fair wage and take care of our widows and orphans.</p>

<p>It boggles the mind.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I forgot to mention the “We don’t listen to fact checkers” comment. Oh yeah, and those pesky tax returns that prove he pays less than most Americans and therefore is a total hypocrite when it comes to all this divisive talk about freeloaders…</p>
