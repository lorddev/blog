<h1>Five Months</h1>

<p class="view">by Aaron Lord</p>

<p>I am now taking a moment to reflect on something that makes this day very special.</p>

<p>Today marks five wonderful months of marriage for me and my beautiful wife.  I gave her a card, but those always seem inadequate: the pre-packaged nature of the business forces them to write to the proverbial middle.</p>

<p>Christina, you mean so very much to me.  More than I could ever say.  The rest of my life will be spent as a humble learner under your tutelage as I learn how to dwell with you with understanding, until every look, every sigh, every motion, every word from me becomes not an annoyance, but a joy.</p>

<p>You are beautiful, my Love. Your eyes are doves. You have captivated my heart with one glance of your eyes. Your love is better than wine.</p>
