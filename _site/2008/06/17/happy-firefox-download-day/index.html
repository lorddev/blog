<h1>Happy Firefox Download Day!</h1>

<p class="view">by Aaron Lord</p>

<p>Today is download day for Firefox 3, the latest version of Mozilla’s  awesome web browser.&lt;p&gt;For those of you who don’t know, Internet Exploder is rather unstable  and prone to exploits, so when I have to help friends or family fix  their computers after such a malicious attack by spammers or hackers,  I always recommend that they stop using IE and make the switch to the  more secure Firefox.  As <a href="http://www.challies.com/sideblog/archives/2008/06/a_la_carte_617.php">Tim Challies</a> put so well, “If you are still using Internet Explorer, well, it’s time to upgrade!.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today Mozilla is trying to set a world record for most downloads in a  single day, so get yourself over to <a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/en-US/worldrecord/">www.spreadfirefox.com</a> and get yourself a free copy!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sent from my iPhone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</p>
