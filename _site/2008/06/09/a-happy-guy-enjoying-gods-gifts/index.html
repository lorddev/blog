<p>There’s a Bible study going on at my brother-in-law’s on the other side of town tonight.  I’m not there because I’m on-call at work and have to babysit the servers.  But my wife just told me that <a href="http://possumbane.livejournal.com/">Paul</a> is sitting there with pizza in one hand, and a cookie in the other, and he takes one bite of cookie and takes a bite of pizza to wash it down with before it’s been swallowed.<br /><br />That’s hot!<br /><br />I’ll have to try it one day.  But for now, I’m just sitting here listening to the <span style="font-style:italic;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000001FS6?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=lbmusic&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000001FS6">Rattle and Hum</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=lbmusic&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000001FS6" alt="" border="0" height="1" width="1" /></span> gospel version of “I Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For.”<br /><br />(I wanted to get someone to take a picture with their camera phone and e-mail it to me, but no takers…)&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;<img width="1" height="1" src="" alt="" />&lt;/div&gt;</p>
