<meta name="description" content="Al Mohler has an indepth condemnation of the abominable cover article in Newsweek.  After California’s democratic victory passing Proposition 8 in November, the news media is out in full swing trying to change our Puritan-founded country’s morals.  The author of the Newsweek article says, &lt;blockquote&gt;Would any contemporary heterosexual married couple—who likely woke up on their wedding day harboring some optimistic and newfangled ideas about gender equality and romantic love—turn to the Bible as a how-to script? … Of course not, yet the religious opponents of gay marriage would have it be so.&lt;/blockquote&gt;This is what happens to our culture when its churches water down Scripture with the “whatever it means to you” manner of textual interpretation.  It is strengthened when nominal “believers” go to work each day and behave like the world, while others look on from the next cubicle. Likely this author is convinced from the lifestyles of the so-called “Christians” she is acquainted with, that it is ludacris for anyone to consider the Bible a how-to script for their marriage.  Would that the Christians in her life had lived in a manner worthy of their calling.&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
