<p>This is from page 44 of <a>What’s So Great About the Doctrines of Grace?</a> by Richard D. Phillips:&lt;blockquote&gt;Were no one ever condemned–were there no display of God's judgment  and wrath–there would be no knowledge of the glories of God's grace.   In that case, the true God would be unknown to His creatures, and His  purpose in creation–to display the fullness of His glory–would be unrealized.  Having failed in this purpose, God would no longer be  God.  For this reason, God's decree of reprobation is necessary.  God being perfect in every attribute, it is necessary for His every  attribute to be exercised: goodness in creation, power in triumph,  mercy in grace, and justice in wrath.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Sent from my iPhone&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;<img width="1" height="1" src="" alt="" />&lt;/div&gt;</p>
