<h1>Thabiti says it&#8217;s Pastor Appreciation Month!</h1>

<p class="view">by Aaron Lord</p>

<div>October is Pastor Appreciation Month!  <a href="http://blog.9marks.org/2008/10/thabiti-says-lo.html">http://blog.9marks.org/2008/10/thabiti-says-lo.html</a></div>
<p>If you are providentially blessed to have a humble, viligant man of the Word as your pastor, a man who studies to show himself approved, a man who rightly divides the word of truth, a man who lives his life for, by, in, through, and upon the Word of God, then please show him you are thankful for him.</p>

<p>And I don’t mean by buying him a Mercedes, people!  How about something that glorifies God more appropriately, such as spending a significant amount of time in intercessory prayer for him and his family, writing him letters, or blogging about how important he is to you.</p>

<p>Honestly, if it weren’t for my pastor’s influence in my life, I don’t know where I’d be today. Thank you, Patrick.</p>
