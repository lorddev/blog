Flatfoot 56 is out in California on tour from Chicago. They played Chico on Thursday night, and they let me play with them a little bit at last night’s show in Stockton. Afterwards, they asked me if I’d come down and play with them in Santa Cruz tonight!!! I can’t get too much into details right now because I have to leave pretty soon…(But now, if I ever go to Chicago again, the pizza won’t be my only reason!!!)&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
