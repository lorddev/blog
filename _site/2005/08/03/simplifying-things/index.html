Since the very essence of God’s grace is that He has given us unmerited mercy in return for our wickedness, ego should have nothing to do with our growth as Christians.

From someone who spent half of his life growing up in churches, I can say it happens, and more often than you might think.) - Mark Salomon, Simplicity&lt;/blockquote&gt;I am no longer on church staff.
