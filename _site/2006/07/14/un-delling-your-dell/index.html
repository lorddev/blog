<meta name="description" content="Just thought I should follow up on the computer upgrade progress, for those who seemed to be interested in what I was doing with it last year. As I mentioned in my MySpace blog a couple of months ago, I had to replace the motherboard in my computer. I replaced it with an ASUS P4P800 SE from NewEgg.com, which works excellently! I had gone to Fry’s to get a new mobo because I considered it an emergency, only to find out when I got home that the one I picked wasn’t even compatible with my CPU, so I had to return it. This one’s a perfect replacement, although you would need a larger ATX case like mine to hold it (for those of you trying to upgrade your Dell Dimension 2350). The mobo has an AGP video slot, so I also got a new video card with dual monitor &amp; DVI capability. I also replaced the power supply with a new one from Antec. Replace the mobo also meant I had to buy a new copy of Windows to replace the OEM version. Last winter I also added on a 120 GB hard drive to hold all my music. So now there’s nothing Dell about it (except for my Dell LCD monitor, which I purchased separately because it was a great bargain).&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

<h1>Un-Delling Your Dell</h1>

<p class="view">by Aaron Lord</p>

<p>Just thought I should follow up on the computer upgrade progress, for those who seemed to be interested in what I was doing with it last year.  As I mentioned in my <a href="http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&amp;friendID=17285023&amp;blogID=116194105&amp;MyToken=f5ee37df-9cf9-4133-b738-177d3d11d1f8">MySpace blog</a> a couple of months ago, I had to replace the motherboard in my computer.  I replaced it with an <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16813131484">ASUS P4P800 SE</a> from NewEgg.com, which works excellently!  I had gone to Fry’s to get a new mobo because I considered it an emergency, only to find out when I got home that the one I picked wasn’t even compatible with my CPU, so I had to return it.
