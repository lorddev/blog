Like many people, I've been blown away by the magnitude of what happened a week ago on the gulf coast.  I have been hesitant to put up links to donate to charities because I'm broke at the moment and unable to give myself, and I'd rather lead by example.  But we should all be in prayer for all of the people who were affected, and do whatever we can to help.  I heard a story about a guy from San Diego who chartered a huge passenger jet and brought back a dozen displaced families to live with people who had opened up their homes in California.<br /><br />Someone told me that the pastor at the church I used to attend said that God had nothing to do with Katrina.  But Amos 3:6 says: "Does disaster come to a city, unless the Lord has done it?"  God is in control.  I'm not saying that any of those people deserved what happened to them more than the rest of us did.  What I'm saying is: all of us deserved it.  Look at what Jesus said:<br /><blockquote>There were some present at that very time who told him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices. And he answered them, "Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans, because they suffered in this way? No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish. Or those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them: do you think that they were worse offenders than all the others who lived in Jerusalem? No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish." Luke 13:1-5 (ESV)</blockquote>The garden of Eden was a safe place.  No disasters.  No death.  But when Adam and Eve sinned, the Lord removed them from the garden and placed them in a very dangerous world.  Since the fall of man, and due to original sin, we are all deserving of death, and it's only by God's grace and mercy than any of us continue to breathe each minute.<br /><br />Everyone should check out this article by John Piper called <a href="http://desiringgod.org/library/fresh_words/2005/090205.html">"Was Katrina Intelligent Design?"</a>.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2602771351651662379-2198889591861312883?l=mustfollow.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
