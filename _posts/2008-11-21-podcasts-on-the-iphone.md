This is great if you&#039;re on the go and don&#039;t have  <br>your computer with you.  Just search for Sovereign Joy in the iTunes  <br>application on your iPhone. (Note this requires the iPhone 2.2  <br>software update that was just released.)<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='' alt='' /></div>
