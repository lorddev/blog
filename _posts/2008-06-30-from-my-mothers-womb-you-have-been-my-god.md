> Yet you are he who took me from the womb;  
> you made me trust you at my mother’s breasts.  
> On you was I cast from my birth,  
> and from my mother’s womb you have been my God. - Psalm 22:9, 10 (ESV)

Today I went with my wife to her first prenatal doctor's appointment. We got to listen to the little one's heartbeat for the very first time. It was beating precisely in double-time with the mother's (our baby's already got rhythm!). It was very eye-opening, opening the door wide into parenthood, making the experience much more tangible and real. We are very excited and grateful for the amazing gift that the Lord has given us!
