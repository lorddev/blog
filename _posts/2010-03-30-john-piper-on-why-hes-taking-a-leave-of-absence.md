<blockquote>But on the other hand, I see several species of pride in my soul that, while they may not rise to the level of disqualifying me for ministry, grieve me, and have taken a toll on my relationship with Noël and others who are dear to me. How do I apologize to you, not for a specific deed, but for ongoing character flaws, and their effects on everybody? I'll say it now, and no doubt will say it again, I'm sorry. <a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/ResourceLibrary/TasteAndSee/ByDate/2010/4555">http://www.desiringgod.org/ResourceLibrary/TasteAndSee/ByDate/2010/4555</a></blockquote>
