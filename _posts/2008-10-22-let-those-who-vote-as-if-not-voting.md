This morning, John Piper published an excellent <a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/ResourceLibrary/TasteAndSee/ByDate/2008/3347_Let_Christians_Vote_As_Though_They_Were_Not_Voting/">Taste and See</a> article at <a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/">Desiring God</a> entitled, "Let Christians Vote As Though They Were Not Voting".  It is based on Paul's exhortations in <a href="http://www.gnpcb.org/esv/search/?go=Go&amp;q=1+Corinthians+7:29-31">1 Cor. 7:29-31</a> (ESV), to "deal with the world as though [we] had no dealings with it."  Each of the areas Paul addresses, Piper takes and applies to voting.  It's a remarkable specimen of exposition and application.<blockquote><em>So it is with voting.</em> There are joys. The very act of voting is a joyful statement that we are not under a tyrant. And there may be happy victories. But the best government we get is a foreshadowing. Peace and justice are approximated now. They will be perfect when Christ comes. So our joy is modest. Our triumphs are short-lived—and shot through with imperfection. So we vote as though not voting.</blockquote><a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/ResourceLibrary/TasteAndSee/ByDate/2008/3347_Let_Christians_Vote_As_Though_They_Were_Not_Voting/">Read the full article</a>.<div class="blogger-post-footer"></div>
