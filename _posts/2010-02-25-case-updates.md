Note: these are updates from news outlets only, no inside information here.

First, <em><span class="removed_link" title="http://www.paradisepost.com/news/ci_14469887">Paradise Post</span></em> reports some new facts which were not previously published: 1) District Attorney Mike Ramsey says Kevin and Elizabeth "took turns" (previously we were told she held the children down). 2) Ramsey does not think a case against the Pearls "would fly." This is disappointing because the Pearls should definitely be held accountable. It's not just a matter of free speech, because of the authority they hold as ministers: ignorant people obey them. I guess the responsibility is left to us to educate ourselves and all our friends until there are no Pearl supporters left.

Second, there is late news from the <em><span class="removed_link" title="http://www.orovillemr.com/news/ci_14470923">Oroville Mercury-Register</span></em> about today's court appearance. The Schatzes were expected to enter a plea today (the topic of many of our prayers), but they did not. This part of the arraignment is delayed once more because Elizabeth has retained new counsel. The <em>Register</em> also reports that Kevin's lawyer, Michael Harvey, may seek a change of venue.
