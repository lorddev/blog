![Cannon Beach ornament with pirates](/assets/img/2011/10/photo2.jpg)

We picked up this ornament while on our honeymoon in Cannon Beach, OR. _It's awesome!_ Notice the attention to detail, with cannon pointed at the enemy vessel, and even the explosions over the sails!

I think we bought it at <a href="http://www.pignpancake.com/">Pig 'n' Pancake</a>.
