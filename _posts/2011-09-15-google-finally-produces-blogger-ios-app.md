This is a long time coming. But it might just be way too late. Unfortunately, it's not a universal app also optimized for iPad, so I'm not going to be getting rid of BlogPress anytime soon. You can get the new Blogger app from the app store.

P.S. I used it to post this.  
P.P.S. The location feature is better than BlogPress's.  
P.P.P.S. Or not... It's cooler in the UI where you select it, but it doesn't actually append anything to your post.
