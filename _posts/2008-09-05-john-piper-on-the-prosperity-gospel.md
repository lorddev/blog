[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTc_FoELt8s&amp;color1=0xb1b1b1&amp;color2=0xcfcfcf&amp;fs=1]<br /><br /><a href="http://make-it-do.blogspot.com/2008/09/john-piper-and-prosperity-gospel.html">Andi</a> just posted this YouTube video on her blog.<br /><br />This is heavy.<br /><br /><blockquote>I don't know what you feel about the prosperity gospel... but I'll tell you what I feel about it: hatred.<br /><br />It is not the gospel. And it's being exported from this country to Africa and Asia selling a bill of goods to the poorest of the poor.<br /><br />"Believe this message and your pigs won't die and your wife won't have miscarriages. And you'll have rings on your fingers and coats on your backs."<br /><br />That's coming out of America! People that ought to be giving our money and our time and our lives, instead selling them a bunch of crap called "gospel".<br /><br />...<br /><br />That's idolatry. That's not the gospel.</blockquote><br />You can download the whole sermon from <a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/ResourceLibrary/RecentlyAdded/2186_Where_Is_God_UCF/">Desiring God</a>.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2602771351651662379-4675528451558414334?l=mustfollow.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
