Here is another great Michael Horton quote from the <a href="http://www.equip.org/PDF/DF230.pdf">CRI article on authoritarianism</a>:<br /> <div class="ennote"></div><blockquote><div class="ennote">Scripture  admonishes us, [with Christ’s words ‘my kingdom is from another place’]  to avoid either the tendency to confuse the kingdom of God with an  earthly nation (Israel, America, etc.) or, on the other hand, to view  citizenship in one kingdom as completely antithetical to citizenship and  participation in the other. (p. 5)<br /></div></blockquote>I cannot overemphasis the necessity of this Protestant two-kingdoms approach.  Separation of church and state is actually a good thing.
