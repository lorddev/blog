Today is download day for Firefox 3, the latest version of Mozilla's  awesome web browser.

For those of you who don't know, Internet Exploder is rather unstable  and prone to exploits, so when I have to help friends or family fix  their computers after such a malicious attack by spammers or hackers,  I always recommend that they stop using IE and make the switch to the  more secure Firefox.  As <a href="http://www.challies.com/sideblog/archives/2008/06/a_la_carte_617.php">Tim Challies</a> put so well, "If you are still using Internet Explorer, well, it's time to upgrade!."

Today Mozilla is trying to set a world record for most downloads in a single day, so get yourself over to <a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/en-US/worldrecord/">www.spreadfirefox.com</a> and get yourself a free copy!
