I heard this the other day on the "Ask Pastor John" podcast and just discovered they put the transcript online.  <a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/ResourceLibrary/AskPastorJohn/ByTopic/9/3422_What_was_the_most_spectacular_sin_ever_committed/">Here's the link</a>.  I recommend you download and listen to the full version, though.<div class="blogger-post-footer"></div>
