If you'd like to get a taste of what N.T. Wright'sÂ <em>Scripture and the Authority of God</em> is about, the Biologos Foundation has posted a six-part serialized adaptation of a paper by Wright which covers the topics he also addressed in the book. (Biologos has an interest in this subject because of how the matter of literary genre vs. overly-literal biblicism could affect one's interpretation of Genesis.)

Here is the links to the Biologos articles:
