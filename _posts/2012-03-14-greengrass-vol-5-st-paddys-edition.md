<p>I've gone all-celtic for this <a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/1217402077/playlist/0nSaLisfprwFcHj3X5nAxI">special St. Patrick's Day edition</a>, which includes a lot of punk rock to boost your energy for those all-day &amp; all-night college-town parties.</p><p>We'll start off with &quot;Shipping Up to Boston&quot; by Boston's own Dropkick Murphys. This tune was a big hit for them, and was used in a couple movie soundtracks. With very few words, it can be thought of as an instrumental and an anthem at the same time.</p><p>&quot;If I Should Fall From Grace With God&quot; (The Pogues) - This is the title track from their third album, produced by Steve Lillywhite in 1988. This was their best-selling album, topping off at #3 on the UK charts. It's my favorite, too.</p><p>&quot;Ward's Favorite/The Morning Star,&quot; etc. (Celtic Fiddle Festival) - No, it’s not a fiddle camp; it’s not even a compilation: it’s a band! I’ve long been a fan of Kevin Burke… This was recorded live and you can hear the hootin' and hollerin' as the set builds.</p><p>&quot;Dillon's Fancy/Maids in the Meadow/Toss the Feathers&quot; (Kevin Crawford) - Crawford is the frontman for Irish group Lúnasa, this was recorded a few years before that group's inception.</p><p>&quot;The Rare Ould Times&quot; (Flogging Molly) - Here's a number from Molly Malone's darling house band. A song from the 1970s first recorded by the Dublin City Ramblers. Characteristically, Flogging Molly start this tune like a ballad and turn it into something quite different.</p><p>&quot;The Rocky Road to Dublin&quot; (The Tossers) - Chicago's The Tossers provide an energetic angst to this Irish classic. The Tossers are great, as they're technically classified as Celtic punk even though they only use traditional acoustic instrumentation.</p><p>&quot;Billy's Bones&quot; (The Pogues) - From their second studio album, this is a Shane MacGowan romper. &quot;And there's mothers cryin' all over this world…for their poor dead darling boys and girls.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The Morning Dew&quot; (Peatbog Faeries) - Okay, I admit, Peatbog Faeries are a Scottish band, but this is an Irish song, so there. It's a great reel in E-minor. Martin Hayes also has a great version of it on <em>The Lonesome Touch.</em></p><p>&quot;The Irish Rover&quot; (Dropkick Murphys) - Another Irish classic, the Murphys make it a little bit louder. I'm super surprises they didn't record it until their seventh album!</p><p>&quot;Swagger&quot; (Flogging Molly) - Their instrumental hit featuring Bridget Regan's fiddle, it's a great selection for a St. Paddy's mix.</p><p>&quot;The Parting Glass&quot; (The Pogues) - From their second album, this minor-key cover of a classic Irish ballad has a slightly disturbing twinge to it, almost like a mechanical dirge.</p><p>&quot;Heroes From Our Past&quot; (Dropkick Murhpys) - Time for a rocking working-class anthem with plenty of pipes!</p><p>&quot;The Chorus Reel/Ashmolean House&quot; (Jerry O'Sullivan) - Some reels on uilleann pipes with Seamus Eagan on banjo.</p><p>&quot;The Dear Irish Boy&quot; (Willie Clancy) - An air from one of the most famous uilleann pipers of the 20th century.</p><p>&quot;Shane Bradley&quot; (The Pogues) - A beautiful instrumental composed by Shane MacGowan, this tune appears on <em>If I Should Fall from Grace with God.</em></p><p>We'll close with a pretty rockin' version &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; by DKM…</p><p><em>Sláinte!</em></p><p>P.S. Don't drive drunk.</p>
