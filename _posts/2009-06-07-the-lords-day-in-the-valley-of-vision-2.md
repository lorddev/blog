O LORD MY LORD,<br /><br />This is thy day,<br />the heavenly ordinance of rest,<br />the open door of worship<br />the record of Jesus' resurrection,<br />the seal of the sabbath to come,<br />the day when saints militant and triumphant unite in endless song.<br /><br />I bless thee for the throne of grace,<br />that here free favour reigns;<br />that open access to it is through the blood of Jesus;<br />that the veil is torn aside and I can enter the holiest<br />and find thee ready to hear,<br />waiting to be gracious,<br />inviting me to pour out my needs,<br />encouraging my desires,<br />promising to give more than I ask or think.<br /><br />But while I bless thee, shame and confusion are mine:<br />I remember my past misuse of sacred things,<br />my irreverent worship,<br />my base ingratitude,<br />my cold, dull praise.<br /><br />Sprinkle all my past sabbaths with the cleansing blood of Jesus,<br />and may this day witness deep improvement in me.<br />Give me in rich abundance<br />the blessings the Lord's Day was designed to impart;<br />May my heart be fast bound against worldly thoughts or cares;<br />Flood my mind with peace<br />beyond understanding;<br />may my meditations be sweet,<br />my acts of worship life, liberty, joy,<br />my drink the streams that flow<br />from thy throne,<br />my food the previous Word,<br />my defence the shield of faith,<br />and may my heart be more knit to Jesus.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src="/2009/06/07/the-lords-day-in-the-valley-of-vision-2/"' />&lt;/div
