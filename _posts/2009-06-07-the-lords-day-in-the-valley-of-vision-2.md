O LORD MY LORD,  
  
This is thy day,  
the heavenly ordinance of rest,  
the open door of worship  
the record of Jesus' resurrection,  
the seal of the sabbath to come,  
the day when saints militant and triumphant unite in endless song.  
  
I bless thee for the throne of grace,  
that here free favour reigns;  
that open access to it is through the blood of Jesus;  
that the veil is torn aside and I can enter the holiest  
and find thee ready to hear,  
waiting to be gracious,  
inviting me to pour out my needs,  
encouraging my desires,  
promising to give more than I ask or think.  
  
But while I bless thee, shame and confusion are mine:  
I remember my past misuse of sacred things,  
my irreverent worship,  
my base ingratitude,  
my cold, dull praise.  
  
Sprinkle all my past sabbaths with the cleansing blood of Jesus,  
and may this day witness deep improvement in me.  
Give me in rich abundance  
the blessings the Lord's Day was designed to impart;  
May my heart be fast bound against worldly thoughts or cares;  
Flood my mind with peace  
beyond understanding;  
may my meditations be sweet,  
my acts of worship life, liberty, joy,  
my drink the streams that flow  
from thy throne,  
my food the previous Word,  
my defence the shield of faith,  
and may my heart be more knit to Jesus.
