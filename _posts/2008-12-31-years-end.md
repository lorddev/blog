> O Love beyond compare,  
> Thou art good when thou givest,  
> when thou takest away,  
> when the sun shines upon me,  
> when night gathers over me.  
> Thou hast loved me before the foundation of the world,  
> and in love didst redeem my soul;  
> Thou dost love me still,  
> in spite of my hard heart, ingratitude, distrust.  
> Thy goodness has been with me during another year,  
> leading me through a twisting wilderness,  
> in retreat helping me to advance,  
> when beaten back making sure headway.    
> Thy goodness will be with me in the year ahead;  
> I hoist sail and draw up anchor,  
> With thee as the blessed Pilot of my future  
> as of my past.  
> I bless thee that thou hast veiled my eyes  
> to the waters ahead.  
> If thou hast appointed storms of tribulation,  
> thou wilt be with me in them;  
> If I have to pass through tempests of persecution and temptation,  
> I shall not drown...  
> If a painful end is to be my lot,  
> grant me grace that my faith fail not;  
> If I am to be cast aside from the service I love,  
> I can make no stipulation;  
> Only glorify thyself in me whether in comfort or trial,  
> as a chosen vessel meet always for thy use.

Thank you, Father, for the best year of my life.
