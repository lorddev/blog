<div>October is Pastor Appreciation Month!  <a href="http://blog.9marks.org/2008/10/thabiti-says-lo.html">http://blog.9marks.org/2008/10/thabiti-says-lo.html</a></div>
If you are providentially blessed to have a humble, viligant man of the Word as your pastor, a man who studies to show himself approved, a man who rightly divides the word of truth, a man who lives his life for, by, in, through, and upon the Word of God, then please show him you are thankful for him.

And I don't mean by buying him a Mercedes, people!  How about something that glorifies God more appropriately, such as spending a significant amount of time in intercessory prayer for him and his family, writing him letters, or blogging about how important he is to you.

Honestly, if it weren't for my pastor's influence in my life, I don't know where I'd be today. Thank you, Patrick.
