This is from page 44 of <a>What's So Great About the Doctrines of Grace?</a> by Richard D. Phillips:<blockquote>Were no one ever condemned--were there no display of God&#039;s judgment  and wrath--there would be no knowledge of the glories of God&#039;s grace.   In that case, the true God would be unknown to His creatures, and His  purpose in creation--to display the fullness of His glory--would be unrealized.  Having failed in this purpose, God would no longer be  God.  For this reason, God&#039;s decree of reprobation is necessary.  God being perfect in every attribute, it is necessary for His every  attribute to be exercised: goodness in creation, power in triumph,  mercy in grace, and justice in wrath.</blockquote>Sent from my iPhone
