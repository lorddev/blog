Author and pastor John Piper has responded to the disaster with an article at <a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DesiringGod.org</a> entitled "Tsunami, Sovereignty, and Mercy."<br /><blockquote>Another example is the curse that lies on this fallen earth. Those who do not believe in Christ experience it as judgment, but believers experience it as, merciful, though painful, preparation for glory. “The creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of him who subjected it, in hope” (Romans 8:20). This is God’s subjection. This is why there are tsunamis.</blockquote>Read the full text <a href="http://desiringgod.org/library/fresh_words/2004/122904.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.
