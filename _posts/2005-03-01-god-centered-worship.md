<blockquote>In considering the rationale for God-centered worship, we must begin with the realization that worship is the number one priority of the Church.  Jesus' famous statement in John 4:23 that the Father <i>seeks</i> worshipers is unparalleled, for nowhere in the entire corpus of Holy Scripture do we read of God's seeking anything else from a child of God.  <i>God desires worship above all else.</i><br /><br />Thus, every man who calls himself a Christian must understand that worship is the ultimate priority of his life.  Worship is what God wants from you and from me.  Jesus hallowed and substantiated this in His chiding of busy, frenetic Martha, who was so critical of her sister's sitting at Jesus' feet: "Martha, Martha . . . you are worried and upset about many things, but only one thing is needed.  Mary has chosen what is better, and it will not be taken away from her" (Luke 10:41, 42). (R. Kent Hughes, <i>Disciplines of a Godly Man</i>, 111)</blockquote><blockquote>Nowhere in all the Scriptures do we read of God's seeking anything else from the child of God.  One often hears that Christians are "saved to serve," and there is a limited sense in which this is true, for throughout eternity as well as during our earthly life it will be our joy and privilege to serve the Lord God.  But this heavenly service will itself be primarily worship (see Heb. 9:14; 12:28; Rev. 22:3).  Nowhere in the Bible are we told that the Lord seeks our service.  It is not servants He seeks, but true worshipers. (Robert G. Rayburn, <i>O Come, Let Us Worship</i>, 15)</blockquote><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='' alt='' /></div>
