"Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change" (James 1:17, ESV).

We accept the good. But do we except the "evil"? (By "evil", I mean it looks like a disaster to us. I do not mean moral evil or sin. God does not sin.)

Job 2:9-10 (ESV) says,
<blockquote>Then his wife said to him, “Do you still hold fast your integrity? Curse God and die.” But he said to her, “... Shall we receive good from God, and shall we not receive evil?” In all this Job did not sin with his lips.</blockquote>
Everything that happens to us, happens because God wills it.  This is the best of all possible worlds. God created <em>this</em> universe because it will bring him more glory than any other possible universe he could have created.

I have quoted Edwards on this before:
<blockquote>What we mean, we completely express thus—That God decrees all things harmoniously, and in excellent order, one thing harmonizes with another, and there is such a relation between all the decrees, as makes the most excellent order.</blockquote>
Come what may.  This is still the best reality possible.
