Those of you who know me may or may not know that I'm not a fan of choose-your-own-adventure religion. So this year, as I presided over our own Thanksgiving bounty, I chose a prayer from the book of Puritan prayers called <em>The Valley of Vision</em> (substituting "we" for "I", etc.):

> O My God,
> 
> Thou fairest, greatest, first of all objects, my heart admires, adores, loves thee, for my little vessel is as full as it can be, and I would pour out all that fullness before thee in ceaseless flow.
> 
> When I think upon and converse with thee ten thousand delightful thoughts spring up, ten thousand sources of pleasure are unsealed, ten thousand refreshing joys spread over my heart, crowding into every moment of happiness.
> 
> I bless thee for the soul thou hast created, for adorning it, for sanctifying it, though it is fixed in barren soil;
> 
> I bless thee for body thou hast given me, for preserving its strength and vigour, for providing senses to enjoy delights, for the ease and freedom of my limbs, for hands, eyes, ears that do thy bidding;
> 
> I bless thee for thy royal bounty providing my daily support, for a full table and overflowing cup, for appetite, taste, sweetness;
> 
> I bless thee for social joys of relatives and friends, for ability to serve others, for a heart that feels sorrows and necessities, for a mind to care for my fellow-men, for opportunities of spreading happiness around, for loved ones in the joys of heaven, for my own expectation of seeing thee clearly.
> 
> I love thee above the powers of language to express, for what thou art to thy creatures. Increase my love, O my God, through time and eternity.
