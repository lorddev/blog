Michael McKinley over at <a href="http://blog.9marks.org/2008/09/does-your-churc.html">9Marks</a> posted about a glossy mailer he received announcing a new church in his area which intends to draw crowds not only with a secular-sounding rock band--that would be one thing, and from my background, I wouldn't be so offended by that, but promoting it as a reason for people to come to your church?  Come on!  What makes this even worse, they're covering the hits as well...<div><blockquote>Does your church music suck?<br /><br />We're with you. That's why we started _____, a new church where our music sounds more like what you have one your iPod or listen to in your car. Every week we also cover some of your favorite Guitar Hero and Rock Band classics, along with current songs by bands like: Coldplay, All-American Rejects, Daughtry and others.<br /><br />Yes, we actually play those songs. And no, we don't "Jesus-up" the lyrics.</blockquote>It just goes from bad to worse, exactly like in 2 Kings 17:7-23.  In verse 8 (ESV) it says that Israel "walked in the customs of the nations whom the LORD drove out before the people of Israel" (think postmodernism and syncretism in the church), and by verse 17 they're killing their sons and daughters on the altars of their idolatry (think abortion), until finally, the Lord "cast them out of his sight."</div><div><br /></div><div>Pray for the elect in this country, that they will not be led astray (if possible) by the wolves in sheep's clothing (Mark 13:22).</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"></div>
