I'm never riding the bus again, nor recommending it to anybody. I was standing at the stop in front of city hall and the guy didn't stop for me. He said I was outside the circle of intent even though I was 5' away from the pole and there was no one else on the whole block. I ran 4 blocks on my sprained ankle to catch the bus at 2nd &amp; Salem and the driver argued with me and said it was my own damn fault for not standing on the curb.

Fortunately it was a shift change or he wouldn't have let me on.

Never riding the bus again.
