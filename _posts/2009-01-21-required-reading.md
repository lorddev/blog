<a href="https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/the-president-the-passengers-and-the-patience-of-god">John Piper</a> uses Matthew 10:29 and Daniel 2:21 to <a href="https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/the-president-the-passengers-and-the-patience-of-god">reflect</a> on how the wondrous works God is performing in our land were ordained to demonstrate his mercy and longsuffering.  Here's an excerpt:<div><blockquote>If God guides geese so precisely, he also guides the captain’s hands. God knew that when he took the plane down, he would also give a spectacular deliverance. So why would he do that? If he means for all to live, why not just skip the crash?<br /><br />Because he meant to give our nation a parable of his power and mercy the week before a new President takes office. God can take down a plane any time he pleases—and if he does, he wrongs no one. Apart from Christ, none of us deserves anything from God but judgment. We have belittled him so consistently that he would be perfectly just to take any of us any time in any way he chooses.<br /><br />But God is longsuffering. He is slow to anger. He withholds wrath every day. This is what we saw in the parable. The crash of Flight 1549 illustrates God’s right and power to judge. The landing of the plane represents God’s mercy. It was God’s call to all the passengers and all their families and all who heard the story to repent and turn to God’s Son, Jesus Christ, and receive forgiveness for sin.</blockquote></div><div>I strongly encourage you to <a href="https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/the-president-the-passengers-and-the-patience-of-god">read this article</a> and pass it along.<br /></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"></div>
