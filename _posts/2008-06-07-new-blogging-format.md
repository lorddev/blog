Perhaps you've noticed I haven't blogged in a while. One reason is that I've been busy with family life, with my beautiful bride Christina.  And another is my busy church life. Another reason I haven't blogged is that I had been intending to upgrade to the latest version of MovableType so that I could take advantage of the CAPTCHA plug-in to block comment spam.  But upgrading MovableType is such a pain...

So, I decided to switch from MovableType to Blogger. For one thing,  I have high praise for Google's technology, with Gmail's spam fighting technology and smooth Ajaxian interface, their powerful search engine, and cool developer tools like <a href="http://gears.google.com">Google Gears</a>.

Another reason for the switch is that MovableType does not work very  well on Windows servers, and as a .NET developer, of course my site is hosted on Windows. Also, upgrading MovableType is a pain. With  Google's Blogger, the posting interface is online, and their software  updates are therefore automatic. This should therefore remove the  obstacles to posting new blogs. Oh, and I can also post directly from  my iPhone, which is definitely a plus!
