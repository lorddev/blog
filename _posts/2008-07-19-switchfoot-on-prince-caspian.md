So, I didn't even know they wrote a song for the movie.  We left as soon as the credits began because, having just finished the book the night before, we were not impressed at all with the filmmakers' idea of "poetic license."<br /><br /><br /><br />I read an article online that pretty well summed up what was wrong with the movie.  I think it was on World Magazine, which requires a paid subscription in order to view the articles online, so I wouldn't be able to link to it anyway (my Dad linked it to me, which is why I was able to view the article "for a limited time").  The article mentioned that Aslan was misrepresented (and therefore, so was the Gospel) in that he roared at Trumpkin rather than playing with him.<br /><br />But the biggest issue I had with the movie was the "preventative measures" taking by the Narnians, who chose to attack Miraz's castle unprovoked, even going to the length of attempted murder, which is in stark contrast to the more Davidic behavior of Prince Caspian and the Pevensies in the book.  I bring up King David because when he never attacked King Saul, and even when his son Absolom rose up against him, he sounded a retreat rather than risk shedding royal blood.<br /><br />C. S. Lewis was a theologian more than he was a novelist.  He wrote what he wrote for a reason.  I wish they wouldn't have messed with the story.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='' alt='' /></div>
