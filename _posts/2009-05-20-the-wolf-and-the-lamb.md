I won't remain supper-less, even though you refute every one of my imputations."<br /><br />The tyrant will always find a pretext for his tyranny, and it is useless for the innocent to try by reasoning to get justice, when the oppressor intends to be unjust.<br /></div><div><br /></div><div>HT: <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.nbc.com/Law_and_Order_Special_Victims_Unit/video/clips/sneak-preview-of-liberties/1099401/">Law &amp; Order: SVU</span></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"></div>
