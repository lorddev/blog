Oswald Chambers, <i>My Utmost for His Highest</i>, p. 364:<br /><blockquote>Do not look at someone else and sayâ€”Well, if he can have those views and prosper, why cannot I?  You have to walk in the light of the vision that has been given to you and not compare yourself with others or judge them, that is between them and God.  When you find that a point of view in which you have been delighting clashes with the heavenly vision and you debate, certain things will begin to develop in you--a sense of property and a sense of personal right, things of which Jesus Christ made nothing.  He was always against these things as being the root of everything alien to Himself.  "A man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things that he possesseth."</blockquote><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='' alt='' /></div>
