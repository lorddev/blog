<blockquote>Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their toil. For if they fall, one will lift up his fellow. But woe to him who is alone when he falls and has not another to lift him up! Again, if two lie together, they keep warm, but how can one keep warm alone? And though a man might prevail against one who is alone, two will withstand himâ€”a threefold cord is not quickly broken. Eccl. 4:9-12, ESV</blockquote>Here is Susanna Spurgeon's postscript to a particularly sad chapter in her husband's autobiography, which recalled many of the terrible things people had said about him:
<blockquote>A strange serenity has brooded over my spirit as these chapters have recalled the heartless attacks made on God's servant... for he is so safe now, "with God eternally shut in"...

But at the time of their publication what a grievous affliction these slanders were to me! My heart alternately sorrowed over him, and flamed with indignation against his detractors. For a long time I wondered how I could set continual comfort before his eyes, till, at last I hit upon the expedient of having the following verses printed in large Old English type, and enclosed in a pretty Oxford frame.  (This was before the days of the illuminated mottoes which at present are so conspicuous in our homes, and so often silently speak a message from God to us.

<blockquote>"Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for My sake. Rejoice and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in Heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you." --<i>Matthew</i> v. 11, 12</blockquote>
The text was hung up in our own room and was read over by the dear preacher every morning,--fulfilling its purpose most blessedly, for it strengthened his heart, and enabled him to buckle on the invisible armour, whereby he could calmly walk among men, unruffled by their calumnies, and concerned only for their best and highest interests.  --<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=KJQEAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=spurgeon%20autobiography&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;pg=PA61&amp;ci=54,329,856,865&amp;source=bookclip"><i>The Autobiography of Charles H. Spurgeon</i></a>, p. 61</blockquote>I am so thankful to have my wife by my side.  I love you.
