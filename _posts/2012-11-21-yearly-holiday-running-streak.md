The <a href="http://www.runnersworld.com/cold-weather-running/2012-holiday-running-streak">running streak</a> is back for 2012. A nice way to burn a ton of calories and deal with the stress of the holidays, and not be all alone while doing so (even if everyone else who's doing it are <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rwrunstreak">people on Twitter</a> who you don't even know).

I had a hard time last year because I was in the middle of training for a half-marathon and therefore needed rest days between my long workouts. But this year I'm taking advantage of the streak to build my base back up after a long hiatus.
