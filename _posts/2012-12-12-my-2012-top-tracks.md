According to <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/alord1647fm/charts?subtype=tracks">Last.fm</a>, these were my top tracks of 2012. Most of these are from my <em>Paxil</em> playlist, and obviously I had some favorite albums that I listened to a lot.

(I thought I'd publish it before New Years to avoid contaminating the results with Sufjan Christmas tunes...)
