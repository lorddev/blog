I've been meaning to post on this for a while. Mark Driscoll <a href="http://www.marshillchurch.org/audio/driscoll_sebts_092107.mp3">spoke about the Emergent church</a> at Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary in 2007. It's a very good message that describes the history of the Emergent church, his involvement with the Emergent movement and subsequent separation, and the movement's dangerous doctrines. The message brings a lot more insight into the issue than any other sources I've seen. The tone is very serious, and I actually think it's on the level of the D.A. Carson <a href="http://www.monergism.com/directory/link_category/Audio-and-Multimedia/All-Speakers-Lectures-and-Sermons/DA-Carson/Emergent-Church/">series</a> that's available on Mongergism. It is a departure from his usual joviality, and it marks a new shift in Driscoll's stance, in my opinion.

One of the things I thought was especially helpful was the way he broke down different classifications, since some of the leaders in that camp are heretics and others actually fit within the realm mainstream Evangelicals, doctrinally speaking. I highly recommend that you <a href="http://www.marshillchurch.org/audio/driscoll_sebts_092107.mp3">download this message</a> and equip yourself to speak out with words of warning and exhortation for any young people you might know who have shown openness or enthusiasm for the pastors and authors who are part of that movement.
