The Big Two when it comes to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_%28file_format%29">RSS</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_%28standard%29">Atom</a> feed readers are <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/">Bloglines</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/view/#overview-page">Google  Reader</a>. I started using Bloglines years ago to keep track of my  friends' Xanga entries. Nobody I know uses Xanga anymore, but I continued  using Bloglines to manage my blog subscriptions.  Now they have a   public beta version, which is pretty cool.  And I've been using their  iPhone version to read blogs on my iPhone.<p>Bloglines was fine when all I wanted to do was be notified that  someone had updated their blog (by way of the indicator in the system  tray), but then I used to go directly to the blog to read the post,  and perhaps even leave comments. But now there is so much more content  available via RSS/Atom syndication, so it has become necessary to use  the feed reader to read content as well. Furthermore, the mobile  versions are optimized for reading on the iPhone, and you can't say  that about every individual blog out there.</p><p>However, I am making the switch to Bloglines' chief competitor, Google  Reader.  My chief complaint with Bloglines (standard) is that when you  view a feed, it automatically marks all available entries as read.  They seem to be addressing this issue with the beta version, but this  doesn't help on the iPhone, which retrieves 5 entries at a time (and  marks them as read).</p><p>Google Reader, however, uses Ajax technology to mark an entry as read  based on whether the entry is visible in your browser! This is a much  better method of keeping track of your blog subscriptions, because  you're guaranteed not to miss anything.</p><p>The only down side, I think, to Google Reader is the smaller font  size. But if you hold the phone sideways (landscape mode), it's a bit  bigger.</p><p>Tips: If you're using Google Reader on the iPhone, push the plus sign  at the bottom of the screen and add it to your home screen (with a  nifty little icon, too!). Also, in the footer next to the copyright,  you can select "Mobile" or "Classic". To use the best iPhone version,  select "Mobile". It makes use if Ajax's asynchronous loading of data  and has more features than the other version.</p><p>Oh, and on another note, the brand-new MySpace App on iPhone 2.0 rocks!!!  The  comments interface is great. And you can even upload photos straight  from your phone (unfortunately, you can't move them to a different  folder, though). What I really don't get, though, is why you need to  fill out a stinkin' captcha form if you're using an iPhone! Still, the  app is cleaner and more elegant than any other form of MySpace interface I've ever seen, and just might make MySpace something I'll  enjoy using again!  (It doesn't let you view or edit blogs, but who uses MySpace for blogging anyway?)<br /></p><p>Sent from my iPhone</p><p>P.S.
