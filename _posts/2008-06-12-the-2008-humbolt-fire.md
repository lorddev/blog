This is the view looking south from the front door at work.

The fire has been going for over 24 hours. Yesterday the wind was blowing South, but judging by this cloud, it's blowing west now, towards the city. <a href="http://newstalk1290.wordpress.com/2008/06/11/interactive-fire-map/">KPAY has a link</a> to a Google Maps page depicting the burn zone and evacuation areas. There are a lot of people from work who live in Paradise, so this is more than an inconvenience for them and their families.
