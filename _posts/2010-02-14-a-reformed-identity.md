<blockquote>The Reformed understanding of things is that we do not have immediate access to God's being.  We have <i>mediated</i> access through God the Son incarnate and through the preaching of the gospel and the administration of the sacraments.  The goal of our theology is to think God's thoughts <i>after</i> him, as his image-bearers, as analogues.  â€”R. Scott Clark, <i>Recovering the Reformed Confession</i>, p. 151</blockquote><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src="/blog/a-reformed-identity/"' /></div>
