So-o-o looking forward to the update tomorrow.

Here's <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/softwareupdate/">Apple's description</a> of the new features, and a <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/iphone_30_is_coming_tomorrow_here_is_what_you_can.php">more in-depth review</a> on ReadWriteWeb.

Some of the highlights I'm looking forward to:

<ul>
	<li>Slow-speed scrubbing is going to be great for listening to lengthy theology podcasts; when I miss something or want to transcribe a section, I can waste a lot of time skipping back much further than necessary.</li>
	<li>I'm also looking forward to SDK features like Push Notifications, which I hope will allow me to stay logged into Skype and Yahoo! Messenger even when I don't have the apps open.</li>
	<li>Another think I'm excited about is the first-party voice recorder, which will stay on even if you go read a note or e-mail or web page. I'm just hoping it will let you download your recordings to your computer (this would be a great tool for songwriters and podcasters!).</li>
	<li>I also think the Copy &amp; Paste features (and the ability to do so with images and not just text) will greatly facilitate mobile blogging. Now they just need to come out with a good blogging app...</li>
</ul>
