So I was wondering whether to use <a href="http://tapulous.com/twinkle/">Twinkle</a> or <a href="http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific">Twitterific</a> on my iPhone, I Googled the two and found these <a href="http://www.twitscoop.com/twits/search?q=twitterific+twinkle&amp;commit=search">twitscoop results</a>, where the consensus seems to be Twinkle. What's ironic is that I was going to post on <a href="http://twitter.com/alord">twitter</a> about this, but it's down at the moment...

(Note: The search results are dynamic and up-to-the-moment, so that link will probably become outdated in the not-to-distant future.)
