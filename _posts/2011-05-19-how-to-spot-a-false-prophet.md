In light of the impending Judgment Day, I'd like to point put some things that are stated a bit more explicitly in Scripture than the date of the end of the world, namely, two easy ways to spot a false prophet.<br /><br />1) Anyone who says they know the date of the end is a false prophet. Jesus said not even he knows, but only the Father. (Mark 13:32)<br /><br />2) Anyone who says "Look, Jesus is back! He's here in the desert!" (Mt 24:23, 24) And yet we have had a plethora of cults throughout the ages who say just that.<br /><br />Posted from my iPhone<br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src="/how-to-spot-a-false-prophet"' /></div>
