[In the Malibu Times](https://malibutimes.com/article_09e79e26-320b-5ad4-99f0-185af0e3139f):

> The Owens returned to America in November 1992. A year later they founded Malibu Vineyard Church, for which Owen was pastor, whose first meeting was held at Webster Elementary School and had 150 attendees. The Vineyard Church eventually moved into a building on Stuart Ranch Road and held four services to accommodate its many members.
> 
> Owen remained pastor of Malibu Vineyard Church until 2004...
> 
> Owen was sick for two years before he died, during which he continued to minister from his home and mentor younger pastors.
