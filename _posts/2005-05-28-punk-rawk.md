<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/71866444@N00/24744990/" title="Photo Sharing"><img alt="Flatfoot 56 - 2005 013" height="181" src="http://photos21.flickr.com/24744990_dc655e83f8_m.jpg" width="240" /></a><br /><br />As soon as I discovered punk rock, I starting thinking how cool it would be if there were some sort of fusion that incorporated violin into it, but I didn't know anyone else who thought this was a good idea.  Then 4 years ago I discovered Flogging Molly and saw my two favorite modern musical genres--Celtic and punk--joined.  And last night, I actually got to play fiddle with a punk band!  <a href="http://www.flatfoot56.com/">Flatfoot 56</a> is out in California on tour from Chicago.  They played Chico on Thursday night, and they let me play with them a little bit at last night's show in Stockton.  Afterwards, they asked me if I'd come down and play with them in Santa Cruz tonight!!!  I can't get too much into details right now because I have to leave pretty soon...<br /><br />(But now, if I ever go to Chicago again, the pizza won't be my only reason!!!)
