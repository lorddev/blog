After 100 years of revolution Sinn Fein and the Irish Republican Army are disarming and dismantling and decommissioning hidden weapons and bunkers (as well as the visible ones).

Says Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams:

> There is a time to resist, to stand up and to confront the enemy by arms if necessary. In other words, unfortunately, there is a time for war. There is also a time to engage, to reach out and put war behind us. This is that time.
