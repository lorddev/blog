<p>I've added a "make a playlist" habit on Lift. Mixtapes always bring me joy, so I think making a habit out of this will help me with my happiness issues. This one is mostly modern indie with a classic twist (you know, those bands that either deliberately or accidentally sound like they're from the 70s). And The Clash, who actually were from the 70s. There's also a bit of a reggae theme.</p>
