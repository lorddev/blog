Life is a journey.<br /><br />The English words <i>journal</i> and <i>journal</i> are borrowed from Middle French, and share the same root, <i>jour</i>, meaning day.  Life is a journey, and journals, whether they be travel journals or journals written at home, convey that attitude.  A.W. Tozer in <i>The Pursuit of God</i> does a good job of illustrating the spiritual walk as a lifelong journey, growth in personal intimacy with God, a trip of the kind where you never reach the end, because there is always further to go.<br /><br />So that's why I've converted the blog from the "i once had dreads..." theme (about the past) to the road theme, which is about a continued journey into the future.  The poem is from Tolkien.  The original banner picture was taken at Deer Creek Falls on Hwy. 32, but I plan to change it up every once in a while with new pictures of new roads.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='' alt='' /></div>
