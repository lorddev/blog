One of the rules of blogging is that you have to do it on a regular basis to keep your readers interested. Unfortunately this is not always possible. Sometimes things can happen in life that either require all your attention or drain you of the ideas or creative energy you need.

For the past 4 months my life has been in upheaval—you may have noticed my blogging frequency having dropped considerably in mid-April. I had suffered a certain fate at the hands of office politicians at a job I had loved for more than half a decade, only to find myself moving on to a job of the royalist suckage, where people stuck in their old ways of doing things refused to listen to anyone who actually had ideas. And I suffered major depression as a result of both of these situations as well as the trauma of the drastic switch from one to the other.

But I have come out on the other side, now working as a freelancer, where I have to deal neither with office politics nor Luddite bosses. As my therapist says, I am on my way. So that's good. And my newfound freedom is leading to what I hope will be the happiest phase of my young family's life.
<blockquote>The Road goes ever on and on
Down from the door where it began.
Now far ahead the Road has gone,
And I must follow, if I can,
Pursuing it with eager feet,
Until it joins some larger way
Where many paths and errands meet.
And whither then? I cannot say.
—J.R.R. Tolkien</blockquote>
