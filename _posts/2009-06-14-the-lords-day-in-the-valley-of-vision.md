<!--.hangingindent { padding-left:1cm;text-indent: -1cm; }-->"Lord's Day Eve"  
  
God of the passing hour,  

Another week has gone and I have been preserved  
in my going out,  
in my coming in.

Thine has been the vigilance that has turned  
threatened evils aside;

Thine the supplies that have nourished me;

Thine the comforts that have indulged me;  

Thine the relations and friends that have  
delighted me;

Thine the means of grace which have edified me;  

Thine the Book, which, amidst all my enjoyments,  
has told me that this is not my rest,  

that in all successes one thing alone is needful,  
to love my Savior

Nothing can equal the number of thy mercies  
but my imperfections and sins.

These, O God, I will neither conceal nor palliate,  
but confess with a broken heart.

In what condition would secret reviews  
of my life leave me  

were it not for the assurance that with thee  
there is plenteous redemption,  
that thou art a forgiving God,  
that thou mayest be feared!

While I hope for pardon through the blood  
of the cross,  

I pray to be clothed with humility,  
to be quickened in thy way,  
to be more devoted to thee,  
to keep the end of my life in view,  
to be cured of the folly of delay and indecision,  
to know how frail I am,  

to number my days and apply my heart  
unto wisdom.
