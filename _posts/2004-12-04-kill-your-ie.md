More than a year ago I e-mailed <a href="http://www.relevantmagazine.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Relevant</a> and asked them to fix their website because it was always crashing my Netscape.  (Now, don't misunderstand me--I'm not a hardcore Netscape user, but during this particular period I was testing out other browsers, and also using them to debug clients' sites.)  When they responded to my e-mail, they said that it wasn't worth it to make sure the website worked for Netscape because 99.9% of web users were using Internet Explorer.  I've since deleted the e-mail, and they've since changed their policy on crashing non-IE browsers...<br /><br /><a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/?q=affiliates&amp;id=44734&amp;t=49"><img align="left" alt="Get Firefox!" border="0" src="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/community/images/affiliates/Banners/125x125/rediscover.png" title="Get Firefox!" /></a> After years of toying with the idea of leaving Internet Explorer, I finally made the leap.  When Firefox asked me so nicely if it could be my default browser, I clicked "OK".<br /><br />Of course, this meant I had to fix my own <a href="http://www.lorddesign.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">site</a> to make it cross-browser compatible (translate vbscript to javascript, delete the Microsoft gradient filters, etc.).  While I was at it, I finally added a the long-awaited <a href="http://www.lorddesign.net/">client list</a> and updated my skillset as well.<br /><br />The coolest thing to happen by far since switching to Firefox is that my Outlook Express loads a billion times faster.  Who'd a' thunk it?<br /><br />I highly recommend this <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2004/09/29/cx_ah_0929tentech.html?partner=tentech_newsletter" target="ext" rel="noopener">article</a> on <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2004/09/29/cx_ah_0929tentech.html?partner=tentech_newsletter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forbes.com</a> about the <a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/?q=affiliates&amp;id=44734&amp;t=49" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firefox</a> browser, as well as <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/computersecurity/2004-09-08-zombieinfect_x.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this one</a> about PC security on <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/computersecurity/2004-09-08-zombieinfect_x.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USATODAY.com</a>.  Oh, and one more on <a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2103152/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Slate.com</a> (imagine that: a Microsoft employee rooting for the competition!).<br /><br /><b>Update circa 2011:</b> I use Chrome now. IE 9 is supposed to be a lot better than the old ones, but it's not cross-platform, and it's too little too late...<div class="blogger-post-footer"></div>
