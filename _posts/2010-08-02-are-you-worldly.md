"Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect." Romans 12:2 (ESV)<br /><br /><a href="http://www.whitehorseinn.org/">White Horse Inn</a>'s Rod Rosenblatt was on the conservative Lutheran talk radio program <a href="http://issuesetc.org/">Issues, Etc.</a> from July 12-16.  On Wednesday's <a href="http://issuesetc.org/podcast/533071410H2S2.mp3">episode</a>, he talked about old-line Protestant liberalism's view of Scripture as a product of evolution, the view that "only the uneducated would say what Grandma says, that this is God's very word. The educated know better, and if it's use at all, it's as a springboard to your sort of experience of... not even salvation--that they didn't believe in either--your experience of deeper education on things important."<blockquote>When Christians get together and start talking about "worldly"... the things that come up are from the saloon in the early Americas, you know, cigar smoking and whiskey drinking and that sort of thing.  We don't see that <em>worldly</em> first applies to joining up with the skepticism of a given age. It's first of all a matter of the mind. And it's tough to go up against what 90% of your own contemporaries think is what's in vogue, or a better representation of a position than it was a century ago.  That's tough.  But we're up against <em>worldly</em> in the worst sense of the word, that is, a sort of a mental set that's opposed to Christianity, opposed to the person of Christ, opposed to anything creedal, and that occupies the brains of 90% of the educated of our day. Now that's tough.</blockquote> You can download the segment <a href="http://issuesetc.org/podcast/533071410H2S2.mp3">here</a>.<div class="blogger-post-footer"></div>
