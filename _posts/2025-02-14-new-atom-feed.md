I finally fixed the [Atom feed](/feed.xml) for my Jekyll blog. You should be able to access [my feed here](/feed.xml). Since the death of Google Reader in 2013, RSS and Atom feeds have fallen out of favor, though it remains the technology behind podcasting. It serves as a nice alternative to following sites on Twitter. I might go ahead and re-download Feedly...
