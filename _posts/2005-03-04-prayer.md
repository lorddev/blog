I have a buddy who was diagnosed with cancer today.  This is very shocking news, as he is a young, healthy guy.  Everybody please pray for him.  Pray for him, and also for his wife, that God would heal him, and give them the strength to get through.  This guy is a prophet, and he has a gift of encouragement to a level that's hard to find, especially in the every-man-for-himself world of Southern California.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='' alt='' /></div>
