<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="/assets/img/2011/10/piper_natcon_04.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" style="border-color:initial;border-style:initial;border-width:0;" src="/assets/img/2011/10/piper_natcon_04.jpg?w=500" alt="" width="500" height="333" border="0" /></a>I don't know <a href="http://www.matthewhall.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matt Hall</a>. But my buddy Dave referred me to his <a href="http://matthewhall.net/index.php?p=463" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a> about the <a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/Events/NationalConferences/Archives/2004/">Desiring God conference</a> at <a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Piper</a>'s church last fall. After reading Matt's article, I went to the conference website and <a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/ResourceLibrary/ConferenceMessages/ByConference/2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">downloaded</a> John Piper's first session to my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0002DOX9O/lbmusic">mp3 player</a> and listened to it like 5 times. It was so good. The message totally kicked my butt! It was something I really needed to hear, and I wish somebody had prescribed it for me earlier.</p>
I am doubly indebted to both Dave and Matt Hall for exposing me to this material, as well as for providing the inspiration I needed to get my own MovableType web app up and running!
