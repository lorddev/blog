I have a considerable collection of celtic music, as I've been a fiddler for like a generation or something. But thanks to Spotify, I'm a few weeks into a new wave of music discovery. Generally any time you see an album with "celtic fiddle" in the title, it's pretentious. One notable exception is Alasdair Fraser's <em>Portrait of a Scottish Fiddler.</em> And now there's another notable exception: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Play-Celtic-Fiddle-Festival/dp/B0007QS4RS/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Celtic Fiddle Festival</a>. It's not a fiddle camp; it's not even a compilation: It's a band. I've long been a fan of Kevin Burke.
