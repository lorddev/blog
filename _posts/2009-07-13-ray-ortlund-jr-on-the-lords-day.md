<blockquote>If we would stop treating Sunday as a second Saturday, one more day to run to Home Depot, one more day for the kids' soccer games, if we would rediscover Sunday as The Lord's Day, focusing on him for one day each week, what would be the immediate impact between today and one year from today?<br /><br />By one year from today, we will have spent 52 whole days given over to Jesus. Seven and a half weeks of paid vacation with Jesus.<br /><br />He's a good King. Maybe we should put him first in our weekly schedules.
