So, we bought an Airstream.

It's something we've been dreaming about for years. We were thinking about living in one after we lost our house in the Camp Fire. Then the idea kept coming up during every wildfire evacuation over the years since then. It's not an ideal long-term living situation, but it beats hotel-living with a dog.

A couple years ago we rented an RV for a week-long excursion to the Oregon coast to see how we liked RV-ing. It was great, despite some hardware difficulties.

We found our camper in Portland. The Bay Area dealer, which we have visited before, didn't seem to have time for people like us who aren't boujee Silicon Valley types. During our last evacuation for the Park Fire, the GM of the Portland store even called us to make sure we were ok and see if there was anything he could do for us.

They're shipping the Airstream to Reno, and We're going to be picking it up there and camping in the High Sierras for one night on the way home. We're thinking about a Veterans' Day getaway, and then taking it to San Diego for spring break to catch the Padres at the beginning of the 2026 season. Not much to do between those two trips, as the kids will be in school. (Isn't autumn a weird time to buy RVs?) They get a break for Thanksgiving and Christmas, but I can't imagine there would be many campsites open during the winter.

I have the advantage of a remote job. So next summer is going to be killer. We can drive and frolic on the weekends and I can work (a few days) during the week from wherever we end up, as long as there's cell service.
