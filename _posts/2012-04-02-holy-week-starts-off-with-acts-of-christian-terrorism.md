This morning a guy bombed a Planned Parenthood clinic in Wisconsin.

Then another guy took out his gun and <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/02/oikos-university-shooting_n_1397572.html">went postal</a> on all his friends at Oikos "University" in Oakland, a Dominionist institution that claims to provide "a Christian education that is based on solid Christian doctrine and ideology. Our main goal is to foster spiritual Christian leaders who abide by God's intentions and to expand God's nation through them." That's some scary shit.

"Blessed are the poor, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth. Blessed are the merciful, for they will receive mercy. Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God." - Jesus

<strong>Update April 3:</strong> <a href="http://kchonews.wordpress.com/2012/04/03/oakland-university-shooting-shasta-lake-recall-chico-high-speed-chase-updated-high-speed-rail-plan-new-snow-survey-csu-executive-pay-occupy-sf-arrests-oaksterdam-raided-ca-sola/">KCHO reports</a> the shooting in Oakland is "the deadliest school shooting in California history." And <em>The Post Crescent</em> reports the PP bombing suspect has been identified, found, and arrested.
