Leland Ryken has written an excellent article which is a snapshot of what he teaches about Shakespeare in his literary courses. You'll be pleasantly surprised.  Here's a quote:

> More than conventional: scholars who are attuned to the Christian element in Shakespeare's plays correctly observe that there is sometimes a gratuitous element in Shakespeare's Christian allusions, meaning that Shakespeare incorporates Christian references beyond what seem to be strictly required by the context.

You can find it here: <a href="http://www.reformation21.org/articles/shakespeare-as-a-christian-writer.php">http://www.reformation21.org/articles/shakespeare-as-a-christian-writer.php</a>

I highly recommed reading the whole thing.
