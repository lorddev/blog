We picked up the Airstream in Reno. And after a few hours of orientation and hitch installation, we were on our way. Well, except I forgot to bring a can opener for the chili. So we went to Walmart. Then the interchange going north on 580/395 was super confusing, I ended up driving in circles for a bit, and was quite embarrassed about it.

We had wanted to boondock in the national forest on our way back from Reno, but we were thwarted by the government shutdown. So we got a full-hookup spot at a nice RV park in the High Sierras, but they have a strict 7:00 pm check-in deadline when they close the gates. And thereâ€™s major highway construction on the road from Reno. The RV Park hosts warned me on the phone but I had no idea it was that bad. Several miles of one-way on the dirt behind a pilot truck. The hosts were willing to stay 10-15 minutes past closing time to check us in, but we actually arrived 10 minutes early.

I failed to level the trailer properly. It was dark and the kids were clamoring to get inside. The bubble on the tongue jack said it was fine, but the level I brought said it was pretty lopsided when I brought it inside, and when I was sleeping I kept sliding down against the wall!

The RV park is large but cute. All the other campers seem really nice.

The night was much colder than expected, so it was hard to sleep. I think I can see why people winterize their rigs and put them away. I'm hoping it will be warmer on the coast when we go see the redwoods next month.
