But I loaded it up today, and it&#039;s 100% accurate even as  <br>I walk down the street!<p>I don&#039;t know if they fixed a bug, or whether this was caused by an  <br>erronneous setting on AT&amp;T&#039;s end that caused their system to think  <br>that my new iPhone 3G was actually my old first-generation iPhone (we  <br>got that straightened out after MMS went live).<p>Sent from my iPhone<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='' alt='' /></div>
