Just thought I should follow up on the computer upgrade progress, for those who seemed to be interested in what I was doing with it last year.  As I mentioned in my <a href="http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&amp;friendID=17285023&amp;blogID=116194105&amp;MyToken=f5ee37df-9cf9-4133-b738-177d3d11d1f8">MySpace blog</a> a couple of months ago, I had to replace the motherboard in my computer.  I replaced it with an <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16813131484">ASUS P4P800 SE</a> from NewEgg.com, which works excellently!  I had gone to Fry's to get a new mobo because I considered it an emergency, only to find out when I got home that the one I picked wasn't even compatible with my CPU, so I had to return it.  This one's a perfect replacement, although you would need a larger ATX case like mine to hold it (for those of you trying to upgrade your Dell Dimension 2350).  The mobo has an AGP video slot, so I also got a new video card with dual monitor &amp; DVI capability.  I also replaced the power supply with a new one from Antec.  Replace the mobo also meant I had to buy a new copy of Windows to replace the OEM version.  Last winter I also added on a 120 GB hard drive to hold all my music.  So now there's nothing Dell about it (except for my Dell LCD monitor, which I purchased separately because it was a great bargain).<div class="blogger-post-footer"></div>
